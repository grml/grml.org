Documentation of
<url url="http://grml.org/config/" name="the grml config-framework">.
Created with Vim and sgml2html (debian package linuxdoc-tools).

<sect>Introduction
<p>

With the config-framework it is possible to save the configuration of a running
grml system and restore it again. save-config is a script to create the
configuration file(s) and store it on a specific place. It's possible to
use save-config interactive (useful for beginners) and non-interactive
(useful for experts and automatization). restore-config is a script to
restore the configuration via using the stored configuration-file.
Several bootoptions provide additional features. Whileas the framework
might look complicate it's very powerful and as soon as you are used to
the options you will find it very easy and comfortabel to use it. Just
take a look at the available options and read through the section
<ref id="usage_scenario" name="Usage Scenarios">.

<sect>Scripts

<sect1>save-config - save configuration
<p>
Calling the script 'save-config' without any further options will start
the script in interactive mode. No further options can be set/are
supported on the command line to avoid problems with environment.

If any of the following options are provided on command line, save-config
will run in non-interactive mode. The following options are supported
for specifying which parts should be saved in the configuration file:

<tscreen><code>
 -etc               =>    save directory /etc
 -home              =>    save hidden files in $HOME (that's: '.*')
 -configdir         =>    save directory $HOME/config
 -system            =>    save unionfs-snapshot (complete system state)
 -all               =>    save /etc, $HOME/.*, $HOME/config and unionfs-snapshot
</code></tscreen>

The following options are supported for specifying destination of
configuration file(s):

<tscreen><code>
 -local                                 =>    save directory /etc
 -mail user@example.com                 =>    save hidden files in $HOME (that's: '.*')
 -ssh [user@]remotehost:/path/to/file/  =>    ssh/scp configuration
 -sda                                   =>    mount /dev/sda and store configuration there
 -sda1                                  =>    mount /dev/sda1 and store configuration there
 -floppy                                =>    mount /dev/fd0 and store configuration there
 -manual /dev/ice                       =>    mount /device and store configuration there
</code></tscreen>

The name of the configuration files must start with
grml_{etc|home|configdir|system|all}_ and end with .tbz so restoring is
possible as (FEHLERFREI) as possible. By default the middlepart will be
namend as the current date (for example '20050722') but you can define
the middlepart manually by using the following option:

<tscreen><code>
 -filename foobar    =>    take foobar as identifier for filename
</code></tscreen>

Example: 'save-config -all -filename foobar' will create a configuration
file named 'grml_all_foobar.tbz'.

<sect1>restore-config - restore configuration
<p>
It is not only possible to restore a configuration via bootoptions but
also via a script namend 'restore-config'. This script exists to restore
a specific configuration saved via 'save-config'. By default
restore-config will search for any files in current directory namend
grml_{etc|home|configdir|system|all}_ and end with .tbz. If there are
several files available you will be prompted to choose a specific one.
The following options are available to fetch the configuration from a
specific destination:

<tscreen><code>
 http://example.com/path/to/grml_all_foobar.tbz  =>    download file grml_all_foobar.tbz and use it for restoring configuration
 ftp://example.com/path/to/grml_all_foobar.tbz   =>    download file grml_all_foobar.tbz and use it for restoring configuration
 ssh://[user@]host:/path/to/grml_all_foobar.tbz  =>    get file via grml_all_foobar.tbz via ssh/scp and use it for restoring configuration
</code></tscreen>

Example: 'restore-config ssh://mika@grml.org/conf/grml_all_foobar.tbz'
will download the file via scp/ssh and restore configuration saved in
file grml_all_foobar.tbz. 'restore-config grml_all_foobar'tbz' will
restore configuration via file grml_all_foobar.tbz located in current
directory.

<sect1>mkpersistenthome - use persistent home-directory
<p>
You have a local partition you would like to use as your home-directory?
Just use the interactive script called 'mkpersistenthome'. It will
create a file namend .grml_homedirectory on the specified partition so
it is possible to scan through the partitions to identify the
appropriate partition. To use the home-directory when booting grml
specify the appropriate bootoption on bootprompt:

<tscreen><code>
 home=/dev/hda3    =>   use /dev/hda3 as the homepartition
 home=scan         =>   scan through the available partitions and search
                        for file .grml_homedirectory
</code></tscreen>

<sect>Boot-Options
<p>
The following bootoptions are supported. Use them at the bootprompt as
documented here.

<descrip>

<!--
<tag/lcfg/ If this option is set, ....
<tscreen><code>
 home=/dev/hda3    =>   use /dev/hda3 as the homepartition

                        for file .grml_homedirectory
</code></tscreen>
-->

<tag/ocfg=grml.org&sol;config&sol;grml_all_foobar.tbz/ If this option is set,
the file will be downloaded via wget from the specified destination.
Tip: Use 'onlineconfig' as reminder for the option.
