        <h2><a name="general"></a><a href="#toc">General</a></h2>

        <h3><a name="whatis"></a><a href="#toc">What is Grml?</a></h3>

        <p>Grml is a bootable live system (Live-CD) based
        on <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>. It is not
        necessary to install anything to a harddisk. Grml includes a
        collection of GNU/Linux software especially for system
        administrators. It specializes on administrative tasks like
        installation, deployment and system rescue.</p>

        <h3><a name="flavours"></a><a href="#toc">What are grml32 / grml64 and grml96?</a></h3>

        <ul>
          <li>grml32-full: 32bit version (kernel and userspace)</li>
          <li>grml64-full: 64bit version (kernel and userspace)</li>
          <li>grml96-full: multi boot version (featuring the grml32-full and grml64-full ISOs combined on one ISO)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Unless you've a good reason to really choose the 32bit flavour we
        <em>strongly</em> encourage you to use either the grml64 or the grml96
        flavour.</p>

        <h3><a name="grmlsmall"></a><a href="#toc">What is the difference between grml-full and grml-small?</a></h3>

        <p>grml-small provides a reduced set of available software compared to
        grml-full.  It provides the same Linux kernel image as grml-full and is
        fully binary compatible. Choose the grml-small flavour if size - for
        whatever reason - really matters to you.</p>

        <h3><a name="get"></a><a href="#toc">Where do I get Grml?</a></h3>

        <p>Grml is open source, you can download it from the mirrors
        listed at <a href="/download">grml.org/download/</a>.</p>

        <h3><a name="whatmeans"></a><a href="#toc">What does Grml mean?</a></h3>

        <p>Grml comes close to 'argl' or 'grrr' in English. People use
        this when they want to express their dissatisfaction with
        software (amongst other things).</p>

        <h3><a name="releasename"></a><a href="#toc">What about the release name?</a></h3>

        <p>Codename of Grml 2020.06 is &quot;Ausgehfuahangl&quot;, which is
	an austrian word for a face mask.</p>

        <h3><a name="requirements"></a><a href="#toc">Requirements for running Grml</a></h3>

        <ul>

          <li>Intel-compatible CPU (i686 or later, preferably Pentium class or higher; although some i586 processors e.g. the 'AMD Geode' are still supported)</li>

          <li>&gt;=384MB of RAM (&gt;=512MB recommended)</p>

          <li>either a bootable CD-/DVD-ROM drive,
          a <a href="#usbboot">USB-boot capable system</a> or a
          network card for booting via network/PXE (check
          out <a href="#terminalserver">grml-terminalserver</a>)</li>

        </ul>

        <h3><a name="accessibility"></a><a href="#toc">What does accessibility at Grml mean?</a></h3>

        <p>The Grml kernel includes support for speakup. For software,
        brltty and espeakup are included.</p>

        <h3><a name="bootoptions"></a><a href="#toc">Which boot options does Grml support?</a></h3>

        <p>Check out the <a
        href="http://git.grml.org/?p=grml-live.git;a=blob_plain;f=templates/GRML/grml-cheatcodes.txt;hb=HEAD">grml-cheatcodes
        file</a> (also available via <a href="http://grml.org/cheatcodes/">grml.org/cheatcodes/</a>). Of
        course <a
        href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html">the command-line parameters</a>
        of the Linux kernel applies to Grml as well.</p>

        <h3><a name="systemd"></a><a href="#toc">Why is Grml using systemd?</a></h3>

        <p>The switch from file-rc to systemd happened for various reasons.
        Grml used file-rc for many years, mainly because it provided a better
        way to control startup behavior via its /etc/runlevel.conf configuration
        than with using sysvinit. Though for us Grml developers this also meant
        that whenever there have been any changes in Debian's startup
        configuration we had to compare our /etc/runlevel.conf setup with what a
        normal Debian system would give us. Users who wanted to remaster Grml
        with a custom startup procedure as well had to practically fork
        maintenance of the /etc/runlevel.conf file. This didn't only mean
        tracking new features/services, but also solve any possible issues
        around it - duplicating efforts and wasting developers time
        unnecessarily. Lately we also started to see problems that no one else
        seemed to have (or cared about enough), for example with multiple network
        cards we ran into race-conditions with resolvconf. Problems like that
        turned out to be release stoppers for us.</p>

        <p>systemd on the other hand provides great documentation, service
        supervision, takes care of parallel service startup and is the default
        init system on most Linux distributions nowadays. This means more users,
        better testing and integration. Logging, startup time investigation (to
        get a fast boot procedure) and identifying failed service startups with
        sysvinit/file-rc was always hard, unreliable or even impossible under
        certain conditions. bootlogd was unreliable (while `journalctl -b` is
        available out-of-the-box with systemd), bootchart was not nicely integrated
        (while systemd-analyze blame/critical-chain works out-of-the-box) and we
        aren't aware of any equivalence for e.g.
        `systemctl --failed`.</p>

        <p>It also turned out that it gives users who want to remaster Grml (or
        build their very own ISOs from scratch using grml-live) more flexibility
        and control
        over the startup process. systemd's override.conf mechanism and preset
        feature provides the flexibility to overwrite unwanted behavior, without
        losing the option to use existing defaults.</p>

        <p>We think it's good that systemd is actively
        maintained and receives attention. The sysvinit/file-rc ecosystem was
        stagnating/non-existent for too many years. Grml used its own initrd
        implementation in its very beginnings, until a more broadly available
        initramfs-tools / live-boot solution appeared, broadening the user base,
        sharing goals amongst different (live) distributions. Back in the days
        Grml - like many other live distributions - had to implement hardware
        recognition on its own. While udev received lots of complaints back
        then, its integration actually solved all the hardware recognition
        problems for the good. systemd's vision of stateless systems is
        something which helps building live systems like Grml.</p>

        <p>While we don't claim that systemd is perfect and doesn't have its
        issues and drawbacks (like any software), we're happy about its
        existence and more than happy about development and support by Debian's
        systemd folks.</p>

        <p>With the Grml release 2020.06 we consider the migration of our stack
        to systemd as complete. If you encounter problems please i
        <a href="/bugs/">file a bug</a> and let us know.</p>

        <!-- TODO: needs to be improved! -->
        <h3><a name="usbboot"></a><a href="#toc">How do I boot Grml from a USB stick?</a></h3>

        <p>Check
        out the <a href="https://grml.org/grml2usb/>grml2usb manpage</a>
        and the grml-wiki page
        <a href="http://wiki.grml.org/doku.php?id=usb">Boot Grml from
        usb-stick/firewire-device</a></p>

        <h3><a name="store"></a><a name="persistency"></a><a href="#toc">Is it possible to store my settings?</a></h3>

        <p>Yes, using the
        a <a href="http://wiki.grml.org/doku.php?id=persistency">persistency
        feature</a>.</p>

        <h3><a name="password"></a><a href="#toc">What are the passwords of users on Grml?</a></h3>

        <p>There are no default passwords - all accounts are locked by
        default for security reasons. Even local logins are not
        possible (unless you set a password or create new user
        accounts as root). You can create valid passwords using "sudo
        passwd [username]" from the shell individually.
        With the <a href="#bootoptions">boot option</a> 'ssh' a password for the
        users 'root' and 'grml' is and SSH login is enabled.</p>

        <h3><a name="version"></a><a href="#toc">How do I find out the version of Grml</a></h3>

        <p>Run 'grml-version' or use the following command:</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
$ cat /etc/grml_version</pre>

        <h3><a name="language"></a><a href="#toc">How do I change the language/keyboard layout?</a></h3>

        <p>The default language of the Grml system is English (en_US.UTF-8).
        All other locales are removed by default.
        But it is possible to change the keyboard layout via either using 'grml-quickconfig',
        the <a href="#bootoptions">boot option(s)</a> 'lang', 'keyboard' and 'xkeyboard'
        or via executing grml-lang when Grml is already running.</p>

        <p>Boot option examples:</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
grml lang=de      # enter this at the bootprompt and you will get
                  # german keyboard layout and german $LANG, $LC_ALL,
                  # $LANGUAGE...
grml keyboard=de xkeyboard=de lang=at # enter this at the bootprompt
                  # and you will get german keyboard and austrian
                  # language variables
</pre>

        <p>'grml-lang' example:</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
% grml-lang de    # enter this in the shell to switch keyboard layout
</pre>

        <p>Note: Run 'grml-setlang' to get a dialog based frontend for '/etc/default/locale'.</p>

        <h3><a name="wms"></a><a href="#toc">Which window managers can I use?</a></h3>

        <p>Starting with the 2011.12 release Grml provides <a
        href="http://www.fluxbox.org/">Fluxbox</a> as window manager.</p>

        <h3><a name="lvm"></a><a href="#toc">Where are my LVM devices?</a></h3>

        <p>LVM (Logival Volumes) is <strong>not</strong> started by default to
        avoid any possible damage to your data. To activate present LVM
        devices execute (replace "$name" with the name of the PV):</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
# Start lvm2-pvscan@$name
</pre>

        <p>or if you don't know its name and to enable all present ones, use:</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
# vgchange -ay
</pre>

        <p>If you want to enable LVM by default just boot using the 'lvm'
        <a href="#bootoptions">boot option</a> which automatically enables LVM.</p>

        <h3><a name="swraid"></a><a href="#toc">Where are my Software-RAID devices?</a></h3>

        <p>Software-RAID (usually known as the mdadm stuff) is
        <strong>not</strong> started by default to avoid any possible damage to
        your data. To get access to present SW-RAID devices just execute:</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
# mdadm --asssemble --scan
</pre>

        <p>If you want to enable SW-RAID by default just boot using
        the 'swraid' <a href="#bootoptions">boot option</a> which enables automatic assembling of
        software raid arrays.</p>

        <a name="terminalserver"></a>
        <h3><a name="booting"></a><a href="#toc">Which ways exist to boot Grml?</a></h3>

        <!-- TODO: needs rework -->

        <p>Of course running from CD/DVD is a common way to boot
        Grml. But Grml provides many more ways to boot:</p>

        <p>It is possible to boot Grml via USB (e.g. USB stick or
        harddisk), firewire, or running from a Compact Flash disk. It
        works out of the box; you don't need to modify anything. Check
        out <a href="http://wiki.grml.org/doku.php?id=usb">the usb
        webpage in the grml-wiki</a> for more details.</p>

        <p>Your computer can not boot from CD-ROM but provides a
        floppy disk? Take a look
        at <a href="http://btmgr.sourceforge.net/">btmgr</a>, <a href="http://ubcd4win.com/faq.htm#floppy">ubcd4win</a>
        or <a href="http://linux.simple.be/tools/sbm">sbm</a>. They
        provide support for booting from CD-ROM via a special floppy
        disk.</p>

        <p>grml-terminalserver makes it possible to boot your system
        via network
        using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment">PXE</a>
        (Preboot Execution Environment). If your network card does not
        provide support for booting via PXE you can still boot it
        either using the provided grub image by grml-terminalserver
        (for example via floppy drive) or
        using <a href="http://etherboot.org/wiki/index.php">gPXE</a>.
        For more information, refer to
        the <a href="/terminalserver/">grml-terminalserver
        webpage</a>.</p>

        <h3><a name="timezone"></a><a href="#toc">How do I configure
        timezone on my Grml system?</a></h3>

        <p>Availabe boot options:</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
grml utc          # set UTC, if your system/hardware clock is set to UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)
grml localtime    # Hardware Clock is set to local time (LOCAL), this is the default
grml tz=$option   # set timezone to corresponding $option, usage example: tz=Europe/Vienna, defaults to UTC if unset

        <h3><a name="zsh"></a><a href="#toc">Why is Zsh the default shell?</a></h3>

        <p>Short answer: because <a href="/zsh/">Zsh rocks</a>, really!</p>

        <p>Long(er) answer: If you don't know Zsh take a look the <a
        href="/zsh/">Grml Zsh reference card</a>.</p>

        <p>If you are a Bash user and don't know Zsh yet, don't be
        afraid. Bash is largely a subset of Zsh and you don't have to
        throw away your knowledge about shell stuff.</p>
