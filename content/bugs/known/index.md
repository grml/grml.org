We track issues at [github.com/grml/grml/issues](https://github.com/grml/grml/issues).

Several Grml sub-projects (grml-debootstrap, grml-etc-core, grml2usb,...) have their own repository and issue tracking, see [github.com/grml/](https://github.com/grml/) to get an overview.
If you're unsure where to report an issue though, feel free to use [github.com/grml/grml/issues](https://github.com/grml/grml/issues) though.

If you find additional bugs, please [report them](/bugs/)!
