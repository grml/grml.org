<h3>About</h3>

<p>grml is a Debian-based Live-CD. It includes a collection of GNU/Linux
software especially for users of texttools and system administrators.
grml provides automatic hardware detection. You can use grml for example
as a rescue system, for analyzing systems/networks or as a working
environment. It is not necessary to install anything to a harddisk, you
don't even need a harddisk to run it, unless you want to (use grml2hd
for this). Due to on-the-fly decompression grml includes about 2.1GB
of software and documentation on the CD.</p>

<p>Whereas grml provides about 2.1 GB of software on a 700 MB ISO,
grml-small is a flavor with only ~75 MB ISO-size (~240 MB
uncompressed). It does not provide a lot of software but the
essential stuff for being a rescue system on a business card CD-ROM
or a small USB device. You can use the Debian package management
system to install software on the fly (assuming you have network
access to a Debian mirror). Take a look at the <a
href="/files/">'Debian-Information'-section</a> if you are
searching for the package list.</p>

<h3>Bugfixes</h3>

<p>Fixed several bugs and issues reported on <a
href="https://github.com/grml/grml/wiki/grml-small_0.4">grml-small
0.4 @ grml-wiki</a>.</p>

<h4>New grml-script:</h4>

<ul>

<li><strong>grml-chroot</strong>: wrapper around chroot with
proc/sys/pts/dev filesystem handling</li>

</ul>

<h4><a href="/grml-debootstrap/">grml-debootstrap</a> (wrapper around debootstrap for installing plain Debian via grml):</h4>

<ul>

<li>Provide interactive configuration dialog if the configuration
file wasn't set up.

<li>Initial support for SW-RAID.

<li>Use root=UUID=... by default if possible to avoid possible
race conditions with libata vs. pata

<li>Use stages based on target information, this gives us the
possibility to run multiple instance of grml-debootstrap.

<li>Use policy-rc.d inside chroot to avoid startup of daemons.

<li>Remove stages after successful execution.

<li>Move stages to /var/cache/grml-debootstrap.

<li>Install devices using our own device tarball instead of
running MAKEDEV (which is just an ungly fork bomb).

<li>Run aptitude with --without-recommends option.

<li>Copy /etc/debootstrap/[s]bin as well to the chroot if they
are present

<li>Allow symlinks when coping existing files to chroot

<li>Pre-seed packages using /etc/debootstrap/debconf-selections

<li>Support DEBOOTSTRAP_OPT for passing extra parameters to the
debootstrap command

<li>Support KEEP_SRC_LIST to allow user to provide their own apt
sources.list from /etc/debootstrap/etc/apt/sources.list

<li>and a lot more updates... check out the <a
href="https://git.grml.org/f/grml-debootstrap/debian/changelog">Debian changelog</a> for details

</ul>

<p>Special thanks to Tong Sun for his contributions and to <a
href="http://www.sipwise.com/">Sipwise GmbH</a> for sponsoring
development of grml-debootstrap.</p>

<p>See <a href="/grml-debootstrap/">grml.org/grml-debootstrap/</a> for more
details regarding grml-debootstrap.</p>

<h4>Special new features:</h4>

<ul>

<li>using same kernel version as in grml / grml-medium for easy
installation further features/modules on request</li>

<li>integration of <a
href="http://www.zsh.org/mla/users/2008/msg00842.html">vcs_info</a>
within Zsh prompt (<a
href="/screeni/gkrellShoot_08-11-03_235459.png">demo
screenshot</a>)

<li>use random password if bootoption 'ssh' doesn't have an
option (thanks to Michael Holzt and Marc Haber)</li>

<li>(re-)implemented <a
href="https://grml.org/cheatcodes/">the
isofrom and tohd bootoptions</a></li>

<li>moved from syslog-ng to rsyslog</li>

<li>added supported for swedish keyboard (thanks to Martin Karresand)</li>

</ul>

<h3>Kernel</h3>

<p>Based on vanilla kernel 2.6.26.8 including <a
href="/kernel/">several patches</a>.  Notice: some more modules
aren't pre-installed but available through the <a
href="http://deb.grml.org/">grml-repository</a>.</p>

<p>See <a href="/kernel/">grml.org/kernel/</a> for more details
regarding the grml-kernel.</p>

<h3>Important Changes</h3>

<p>Using a new <strong>version schema</strong>: as we want to
improve tracking of all the different flavours and releases of
grml we decided to use "$flavour $YYYY.MM" for the stable
releases. No further confusing 'grml 1.1 vs. grml64 0.2'.</p>

<p>Switched from old IDE drivers to <strong>libata</strong>
drivers. What might have been known as /dev/hdX on your system
will become /dev/sdX nowadays.</p>
