========

Release 1.0 - codename Meilenschwein (20070518)
===============================================

Fixed several bugs and issues reported on
https://github.com/grml/grml/wiki/grml_0.9

New grml-scripts (some selected ones):

  * alignmargins: adjust the margins and the position of the printed
    contents on the paper
  * dirvish-setup: a simple script for setting up a basic configuration
    for the backup software dirvish
  * grml2ram: copy compressed GRML image to RAM when running grml
    already (based on contribution by Michael Schierl)
  * grml-quickconfig: get fast access to some basic grml-scripts
    (contributed by Michael Schierl)
  * grml-setservices interface for basic configuration of system
    startup/shutdown via /etc/runlevel.conf
  * gsuggest.pl: google suggest - ask google for keyword suggestions
  * iso-term: wrapper script to run x-terminal-emulator in iso885915 mode

New bootparameters/cheatcodes:

  * qemu: installs a default /etc/X11/xorg.conf (without
    having to run hardware detection)
  * debian2hd: install plain Debian via grml-debootstrap
    in automatic mode

grml2hd (install grml to harddisk):

  * support for Grub (now there's a dialog for selection between
    lilo and grub as bootloader)
  * use of UUID and /dev/disk/by-uuid/ by default (provides stable
    booting devices, very important for installation on external
    usb/firewire devices for example)
  * use initrd/initramfs by default now

grml-terminalserver (boot grml via network):

  * better module loading
  * switch from tftpd-hpa to atftpd (resulting in big speedup)

grml-debootstrap (install plain Debian fast and easy):

  * support full automatic installation via debian2hd
  * use aptitude instead of apt-get in chroot-script
  * use of DEBIAN_FRONTEND='noninteractive' to avoid unnecessary
    questions when installing
  * support Debian release with codename 'lenny'
  * support stages (improves cancel/resume of operations)
  * support setting of some important variables via cmdline
  * improved error handling

Special new features:

  * updated to X.org 7.2 / Xserver 1.3
  * updated to libc6 2.5
  * use of UTF-8 as default encoding
  * LaTeX: switch from tetex to texlive
  * grml-x: use of evdev (dropped options -nousb and -nops2,
    added -ps2 and -usb instead), improved error handling and execution
  * grml-autoconfig: dropped userspace/powernowd stuff in cpufrequeny
    scaling in favour of the ondemand-governor
  * integrated grml-quickconfig within zsh-login
  * got rid of grml-sysvinit, using plain sysvinit from Debian
    without any hacks now
  * support basic rescanning in live-cd initrd
  * the grml team manages all the Debian unique packages with mercurial
    using grml-mercurial-utils

Kernel:

Based on vanilla kernel 2.6.20.11 including several patches (Speakup,
Squashfs,...) and additional modules:

  acerhk, aufs, cowloop, drbd8, et131x, exmap, ipw3945, iscsitarget, ivtv, kqemu,
  madwifi, misdn, ndiswrapper, nozomi, openafs, pcan, qc-usb, r1000, realtime-lsm,
  rt2400, rt2500, rt2570, rt2x00, sdricoh_cs, sl-modem, snd-bt-sco, spca5xx,
  sysprof, tidev, tpm_emulator, truecrypt, unionfs

Important Changes:

  * UTF-8: grml uses UTF8 as default encoding. You can deactivate UTF-8
    environment via booting with bootoption lang=$LANG-iso. Some software is not
    yet UTF-8 aware (problem is located upstream, neither at Debian or grml
    itself). More information about UTF-8 at grml can be found at the utf8
    webpage in the grml-wiki.

  * get_tw_cli / get_3ware: get_tw_cli has been renamed into get_3ware as we
    support 3DM2 as well now.

  * fluxbox: the keybindings have been restored to their original (fluxbox
    upstream) behaviour. Now Alt+F# switches between the desktops, Alt+Shift+F#
    sends an application to another desktop. If you want to get the old
    behaviour back you can use the zsh function fluxkey-change.  Packages /
    Software

Updated all packages to Debian Unstable branch by 20070517.

20061206
========

Release 0.9 - Codename Dioptrienotto (20061206)
================================================

Fixed several bugs and issues reported on
https://github.com/grml/grml/wiki/grml_0.8

New grml-scripts (some selected ones):

  * getsf: download project from sourceforge.net
  * grml-ap: set up your box as access point
  * grml-bridge: set up your box as bridge
  * grml-debootstrap: wrapper around debootstrap for installing plain
    Debian via grml
  * grml-router: set up your box as NAT-router
  * qma: fast manual access, speeds up access for reading manpages
  * random-hostname: print random hostname to stdout
  * reread_partition_table: re-read partition table of specific disk

New bootparameters/cheatcodes (some selected ones):

  * dos: boot into FreeDOS 1.0 from the Balder project
  * noswraid: disable search for software RAID arrays
  * lang=$LANG-utf: unicode support, usage example: lang=de-utf8

grml2hd:

  * support customization of grml2hd through /etc/grml2hd/customization
  * allow installation of lilo into MBR of the first disk on the
    system. (Feature based on patch contributed by Alexander Bernauer.)
  * adjust /etc/default/rcS according to bootoption utc/gmt and
    /etc/localtime according to bootoption tz
  * integration of random-hostname

Special new features:

  * updated to X.org 7.1.1
  * unicode support through bootoption lang=$LANG-utf8
  * added FreeDOS 1.0 from the Balder project; boot into it using
    the bootoption 'dos'
  * new handling for added/removed devices: /etc/fstab is rebuild
    automatically if new block devices are added or removed; mounting
    usb devices is possible through /mnt/usb-sd*
  * grml-rebuildfstab (that's a shell command now as well, just run
    'grml-rebuildfstab' to rebuild /etc/fstab) supports fs-LABELs
    and UUIDs; see 'man rebuildfstab' for details
  * split package grml-etc into grml-etc + grml-etc-core (the latter
    one provides the core configuration files for e.g. zsh, screen and vim)
  * bootoption 'grub' boots into The All In One Boot Floppy (which provides
    Grub), contributed by Michael Schierl

Kernel:

Based on vanilla kernel 2.6.18.3 including several patches (Speakup,
Squashfs,...) and additional modules:

  acerhk, acx100, adp94xx, arcmsr, bcm5700, cowloop, drbd8, et131x,
  exmap, ipw3945, ivtv, kqemu, kvm, linux-wlan-ng, madwifi, misdn,
  ndiswrapper, nozomi, openafs, pcan, qc-usb, r1000, realtime-lsm,
  rt2400, rt2500, rt2570, rt2x00, sl-modem, snd-bt-sco, spca5xx,
  sysprof, tidev, tpm_emulator, truecrypt, unionfs

Important Changes:

  * swap partitions: by default grml does not automatically use swap
    partitions anymore. Run 'grml-swapon' when running grml or boot using
    'grml swap' for enabling all detected and usable swap partitions.

  * software raid: starting with grml 0.9 booting the system searches
    for present software raid arrays. The configuration file
    /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf will be generated by default, to disable this
    feature use the bootopion noswraid. The arrays are not autoassembled
    by default. Either boot using the bootoption swraid or run 'Start
    mdadm-raid' when running grml already to assemble present software
    raid arrays.

  * zsh global aliases: the global aliases setup has been changed; now
    the global aliases (like: 'G' is same '|grep') are not enabled by
    default any more, instead a new setup named 'powerful abbreviation
    expansion' is available. Usage example: type 'N' and press ',.' to
    expand the 'N' into '&>/dev/null'. Take a look at the grml zsh refcard
    for more details.

Removed 62 packages [please notice that some of them are available under
different names/in different packages]:

    # cd /dev && MAKEDEV md

  * There might be problems running DRI with current X.org. Check whether DRI/3d-support
    works for you via running:

    % glxinfo | grep direct
    direct rendering: Yes</pre>

    If it does not return 'Yes' the following command might solve your problem:

    # apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dri/experimental libgl1-mesa-glx/experimental

Updates:

  * Updated all packages to Debian Unstable branch by 20060811.

    Some more modules (for example fglrx and nvidia) are not
    pre-installed but available through the grml-repository.

  See http://grml.org/kernel/ for more details regarding the grml-kernel.

Updates:

 * Updated all packages to Debian Unstable branch by 20060402 plus
   some minor updates until 200604XX.
 * Updated memtest to Memtest86+ V1.65.
 * Updated putty-collection to latest version.
 * grml2hd (install grml to harddisk):
        - check for given mbr option and prompt for activating it if not set
        - changed initrd/initramfs generator from yaird to initramfs:
          now booting via firewire is also possible
        - added resume, brltty, speakup_synth and swspeak to list of
          grml2hd-bootparams so it's easier to use out of the box
        - changed logic in grml2hd dialog for package removal: now select packages
          which should be kept
        -> See http://grml.org/grml2hd/ for more details.

Removed 34 packages [please notice that some of them are available

========

Release 0.6 - Codename Winterschlapfn (20060122)
================================================

Fixed several bugs, including issues reported on
https://github.com/grml/grml/wiki/grml_0.5

Several improved, updated and extended configuration files.

New grml-scripts (some selected ones):

  * bt-hid          connect bluetooth mouse
  * ip-screen       print ip address of configured network interfaces.
                    Integrated into status line of GNU screen.
  * XF86AudioLowerVolume, XF86AudioMute and XF86AudioRaiseVolume:
                    scripts for handling audio volume
  * wm-ng           wrapper script for use with grml-x - provides an easy
                    to use desktop, runs fluxbox with gkrellm and idesk,
                    use via 'grml-x wm-ng'
                    Tip: press Ctrl-Alt-d to switch X resolution to 1024x768
  * noprompt        wrapper script to avoid prompting when rebooting/
                    halting system. Use e.g. via 'noprompt reboot'

New bootparameters/cheatcodes (some selected ones):

  * hostname=...   set hostname to specified value (default: grml)
  * distcc=$NETWORK,$INTERFACE - activate distcc-daemon, usage example:
                   distcc=192.168.0.1/24,eth0
                   activates distccd listening on ip address of eth0 providing
                   access for network 192.168.0.1/24
  * 915resolution=${MODE},${XRESO},${YRESO}     start resolution modify
                    tool for Intel graphic chipset, usage example:
                    915resolution=4d,1400,1050
  * swspeak         get software synthesizer support through speakup's
                    sftsyn, speech-dispatcher and speechd-up
  * debnet          search through local partitions for file /etc/network/interfaces,
                    copy /etc/network to running system and restart networking then
  * forensic        boot without any filesystem access to hard disks so
                    forensic investigations can be made
  * blacklist=module deactivate loading of a specific module. Configured via
                    /etc/modprobe.d/grml. Usage example:
                    blacklist=snd_ens1371

Special new features:

  * grml-tips: run 'grml-tips $KEYWORD' to get hints for $KEYWORD
  * udev fully replaces hotplug-light and discover
  * pcmcia­utils replace pcmcia-cs
    Notice: some kernel drivers (like for example PCMCIA WLAN cards) are not
    autoloaded by default. Run 'hwinfo --netcard' to figure out which module has
    to be loaded.
  * AFS-client support
  * don't use /proc/bus/usb by default anymore
  * improved synaptics touchpad recognition
  * w3m not starting automatically (get it through running 'grml-info'),
    tty1 is not reset on startup (see bootmessages instead)

    snd-bt-sco, spca5xx, sysprof, thinkpad, tidev, vaiostat,
    zd1211

    Notice: madwifi-ng is available in /usr/src as debian package
    but not pre-installed because of conflicts with madwifi.
    Some more modules (for example fglrx and nvidia) are not
    pre-installed but available through the grml-repository.

  See http://grml.org/kernel/ for more details regarding the grml-kernel.

20051024
========

Release 0.5 - Codename Tokolytika
=================================

Fixed several bugs, including:

     #16  in "man grml-scripts" the program grml-init is mentioned twice
     #17  grml-docs: Spelling error of "resources" on the grml startpage
     #18  grml-0.4: booting with 'testcd' complains about 'files not found'

New grml-scripts (some selected ones):

  * save-config     save configuration in bzip2 compressed tar archive
  * restore-config  restore configuration
  * noeject         avoid ejecting of CD-ROM and prompting for it.
                    Use it via 'noeject <cmd>' (where <cmd>
                    is either reboot or halt)
  * service         wrapper script for /etc/init.d/-scripts,
                    use it e.g. via 'service postfix start'
  * grml2usb        create bootable usb-stick (using a grml-iso
                    like grml-small)

New bootparameters/cheatcodes (some selected ones):

  * serial     - activate serial console (tty1+ttyS0 and start mgetty)
  * hd         - boot from (local) primary harddisk
  * bootchart  - run performance analysis and visualization of bootprocess,
                 see /var/log/bootchart.tgz and bootchart-view; take a look
                 at http://www.bootchart.org/ for further information
  * startx[=windowmanager] - start X window system instead of consoles,
                 if no option is given then fluxbox will be taken as default,
                 you can specify any other window manager available on grml
                 as parameter. For example use 'startx=wmii' to start X window
                 system with wmii (through running 'grml-x wmii')
  * grml2hd    - automatic installation running grml2hd, requires additional
                 bootparameters, see bootsplash F9 for more details, usage example:
                 grml2hd partition=/dev/hda1 mbr=/dev/hda filesystem=ext3 user=mika
                 -> this will install grml to present partition /dev/hda1 using
                 ext3 filesystem, adding user mika and installing lilo to MBR of
                 /dev/hda; passwords of user root and user are 'grml'
  * netconfig=server.tld/config.tbz - download configuration archive and extract it
                 This bootparameter is part of the new config framework:
                 http://grml.org/config/

Special new features:

  * full automatic installation to harddisk via bootparameter grml2hd possible
  * framework grml-autoconfig: configure hardware-detection
    via configuration file /etc/grml/autoconfig or its interface
    script namend 'grml-autoconfig' - especially useful on harddisk
    installations
  * configuration-framework: new bootparameters and scripts (save-config
    and restore-config), see http://grml.org/config/ and 'man save-config'
    for more details)
  * integration of hotplug-light: speeds up booting
  * got rid of all knoppix packages: this means you get a clean
    Debian unstable system with some additional packages available
    through the grml repository on http://grml.org/repos/
    All packages which are responsible for the core of the grml system
    and provided by the grml team are namend 'grml-*'.

Kernel:

  * Based on vanilla kernel 2.6.13.4 including several patches
    (MPPC/MPPE, Reiser4, Speakup, Squashfs,...) and additional
    modules:

    acx100, at76c503a, bcm4400, bcm5700, drbd0.7, eagle-usb, fuse,
    hostap, ieee80211, ipw2100, ipw2200, ivtv0.4, kqemu,
    linux-wlan-ng, lufs, madwifi, ndiswrapper, openafs, pcan,
    pwc, qc-usb, realtime-lsm, rt2400, rt2500, shfs, spca5xx,
    thinkpad, tidev, vaiostat, zd1211

    Some more modules (for example fglrx and nvidia) are not
    pre-installed but available through the grml-repository.

  * We decided to deactivate SMP-support because we noticed
    troubles on some laptops (causing kerneloops, problems
    with booting and ACPI).

  * We decided to compile the kernel with gcc4 and with optimation
    for 586 for improving performance.

  * We are packaging udev on our own to provide perfect integration
    with the kernel shipped with grml. We are syncing packages
    with upstream and the debian version. Works together with
    hotplug-light and upcoming versions of udev will deprecate
    hotplug* completely.

  See http://grml.org/kernel/ for more details regarding the grml-kernel.

Updates:

 * Updated all packages to Debian Unstable branch by 20051016 plus
   important updates (priority >low) until 20051023.
 * Updated memtest to Memtest86+ V1.55.
 * Updated windows-binaries (putty-collection/winscp) to latest version.
 * grml2hd:
            - full automatic (non-interactive) installation
            - support for reiser4 (still experimental, problems with lilo)
            - support for new grml-autoconfig framework
            - improved error handling
           -> See http://grml.org/grml2hd/ for more details.

  * grml-hwinfo:      collect hardware information
  * grml-vpnc-tugraz: connect to WLAN of TU Graz
  * xsay:             text-to-speech system (e.g. run 'grml-x wmi',
                      select some text via mouse and press 'ctrl-alt-v'

New bootparameters/cheatcodes:

  * grml small - disable some consoles when booting (saves a
