<h3>About</h3>

<p>grml is a Debian-based Live-CD. It includes a collection of GNU/Linux
software especially for users of texttools and system administrators.
grml provides automatic hardware detection. You can use grml for example
as a rescue system, for analyzing systems/networks or as a working
environment. It is not necessary to install anything to a harddisk, you
don't even need a harddisk to run it, unless you want to (use grml2hd
for this). Due to on-the-fly decompression grml includes about 2.1GB
of software and documentation on the CD.</p>

<p>Whereas grml provides about 2.1GB of software on a ~700MB ISO
and grml-small is a flavor with only ~75MB ISO-size, grml-medium
tries to close the gap between those two flavours providing an ISO
with ~200MB. It does not provide all the software shipped with
normal/big/large grml but provides essential stuff, a full featured
kernel and the X.org server. You can use the Debian package
management system to install software on the fly (assuming you have
network access to a Debian mirror). Take a look at the <a
href="/files/">'Debian-Information'-section</a> if you are
searching for the package list.</p>

<h3>Kernel</h3>

<p>Based on vanilla kernel 2.6.26.8 including <a
href="/kernel/">several patches</a> and additional modules:</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
at76-usb atl2 aufs madwifi rt2400 rt2500 rt73 squashfs
</pre>

<p>Notice: some more modules (like <a
href="https://github.com/grml/grml/wiki/ati">fglrx</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/grml/grml/wiki/nvidia">nvidia</a>) are not
pre-installed but available through the <a
href="http://deb.grml.org/">grml-repository</a>.</p>

<p>See <a href="/kernel/">grml.org/kernel/</a> for more details
regarding the grml-kernel.</p>

<h3>Important Changes</h3>

<p>Using a new <strong>version schema</strong>: as we want to
improve tracking of all the different flavours and releases of
grml we decided to use "$flavour $YYYY.MM" for the stable
releases. No further confusing 'grml 1.1 vs. grml64 0.2'.</p>

<p>Switched from old IDE drivers to <strong>libata</strong>
drivers. What might have been known as /dev/hdX on your system
will become /dev/sdX nowadays.</p>

<p><strong>Truecrypt</strong> isn't shipped anymore Because
Truecrypt is licensed under a specific license named 'TrueCrypt
License 2.6' which doesn't permit us to distribute Truecrypt. See
<a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/legal/license">section VI/4 of
the license</a> for details.</p>

<p><strong>Locales</strong> provided via /usr/share/locale have
been removed due to space reasons, though /usr/share/i18n/locales
hasn't been modified as well as package specific files.</p>

<h3>Packages / Software</h3>

<p>Details about shipped packages and their versions on grml are
available at the <a href="/files/#debian">Debian section</a>. See <a

list of packages shipped with grml-medium 2008.11.</p>

<h3>Updates</h3>

<p>Updated all packages to Debian Unstable branch by 20th of
november 2008 (plus some further selected updates).</p>
