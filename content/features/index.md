[<img style="border: 0" src="/img/zsh_lover.png" alt="*" />](/zsh/) Grml - Linux for zsh lovers

Grml provides an excellent selection of software packages for installation, deployment and system rescue.
You'll get **sysadmin's favourite tools**.
Choose between a x86 and an amd64 version depending on your needs or just grab the multiboot ISO grml96, providing 64bit and 32bit ISOs in one single place.

Grml provides several scripts and utils which **make life easier**.

The default interactive shell is **[Zsh](/zsh/)** and is configured with a very powerful setup (known as **grml-zshrc**), including a nifty completion mechanism.

**grml-x** is a wrapper for configuring and using the X window system.

**[grml2usb](/grml2usb/)** is a tool for installing Grml ISO(s) on a USB device for booting.

**grml-crypt** is a program that provides an easy wrapper around cryptsetup, mkfs, losetup and mount.

**grml-terminalserver** provides all what's needed to boot Grml over the network (PXE).

**grml-hwinfo** collects information of the hardware the tool is being executed on.

**[grml-live](/grml-live/)** is our build framework for creating Grml, the Debian based Linux Live system (CD/ISO).

**[grml-debootstrap](/grml-debootstrap/)** is a wrapper around debootstrap for installing plain Debian.

**grml-tips** provides useful tips and tricks for daily life on the command line.
