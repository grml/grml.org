<h2><a name="general"></a><a href="#toc">General</a></h2>

<h3><a name="whatis"></a><a href="#toc">What is Grml?</a></h3>

<p>Grml is a bootable live system (Live-CD) based
on <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>. It is not
necessary to install anything to a harddisk. Grml includes a
collection of GNU/Linux software especially for system
administrators. It specializes on administrative tasks like
installation, deployment and system rescue.</p>

<h3><a name="flavours"></a><a href="#toc">What are grml32 / grml64 and grml96?</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>grml32-full: 32bit version (kernel and userspace), ~350MB</li>
<li>grml64-full: 64bit version (kernel and userspace), ~350MB</li>
<li>grml96-full: multi boot version (featuring the grml32-full and grml64-full ISOs combined on one ISO), ~700MB</li>
</ul>

<p>Unless you've a good reason to really choose the 32bit flavour we
strongly encourage you to use either the grml64 or the grml96
flavour.</p>

<p>Please notice that this schema was introduced starting with the
downsized Grml release 2011.12. Until then grml96 didn't exist and
grml32 was known as just 'grml'.</p>

<h3><a name="grmlsmall"></a><a href="#toc">What is the difference between grml-full and grml-small?</a></h3>

<p>grml-small provides a reduced set of available software compared to
grml-full.  It provides the same Linux kernel image as grml-full and is
fully binary compatible. Choose the grml-small flavour if size - for
whatever reason - really matters to you.</p>

<h3><a name="get"></a><a href="#toc">Where do I get Grml?</a></h3>

<p>Grml is open source, you can download it from the mirrors
listed at <a href="/download">grml.org/download/</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="whatmeans"></a><a href="#toc">What does Grml mean?</a></h3>

<p>Grml comes close to 'argl' or 'grrr' in English. People use
this when they want to express their dissatisfaction with
software (amongst other things).</p>

<h3><a name="releasename"></a><a href="#toc">What about the release name?</a></h3>

<p>Codename of Grml 2012.05 is "Ponyhof", AKA &quot;Life Ain't No Pony Farm&quot;.</p>

<h3><a name="requirements"></a><a href="#toc">Requirements for running Grml</a></h3>

<ul>

<li>Intel-compatible CPU (i586 or later, preferably Pentium class or higher)</li>

<li>&gt;=256MB of RAM (&gt;=512MB recommended)</p>

<li>either a bootable CD-/DVD-ROM drive,
a <a href="#usbboot">USB-boot capable system</a> or a
network card for booting via network/PXE (check
out <a href="#terminalserver">grml-terminalserver</a>)</li>

</ul>

<h3><a name="accessibility"></a><a href="#toc">What does accessibility at Grml mean?</a></h3>

<p>The Grml kernel includes support for speakup. For software,
brltty and espeakup are included.</p>

<h3><a name="bootoptions"></a><a href="#toc">Which bootoptions does Grml support?</a></h3>

<p>Check out the <a
href="https://grml.org/cheatcodes/">grml-cheatcodes
file</a> (also available via <a href="/cheatcodes/">grml.org/cheatcodes/</a>). Of
course <a
href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt">kernel-parameters.txt</a>
of the Linux kernel applies to Grml as well.</p>

<h3><a name="known_issues"></a><a href="#toc">Are there any known issues? How about reporting bugs?</a></h3>

<p>Please visit the <a href="/bugs/">bug webpage</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="features"></a><a href="#toc">Features</a></h2>

<!-- TODO: needs to be improved! -->
<h3><a name="usbboot"></a><a href="#toc">How do I boot Grml from a USB stick?</a></h3>

<p>Check
out <a href="https://github.com/grml/grml/wiki/usb#grml2usb">grml2usb</a>
at the
<a href="https://github.com/grml/grml/wiki/usb">usb webpage in the
grml-wiki.</a></p>

<h3><a name="store"></a><a name="persistency"></a><a href="#toc">Is it possible to store my settings?</a></h3>

<p>Yes, using the
a <a href="https://github.com/grml/grml/wiki/persistency">persistency
feature</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="password"></a><a href="#toc">What are the passwords of users on Grml?</a></h3>

<p>There are no default passwords - all accounts are locked by
default for security reasons. Even local logins are not
possible (unless you set a password or create new user
accounts as root). You can create valid passwords using "sudo
passwd [username]" from the shell individually. To set a password
for the Grml user and enable SSH login you can use the 'ssh'
boot option, like 'ssh=yourpassword'.</p>

<h3><a name="version"></a><a href="#toc">How do I find out the version of Grml</a></h3>

<p>Run 'grml-version' or use the following command:</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
$ cat /etc/grml_version</pre>

<h3><a name="language"></a><a href="#toc">How do I change the language/keyboard settings?</a></h3>

<p>By default Grml uses english settings. But it is possible to
change the settings via using either the bootparam(s) lang,
keyboard and xkeyboard or via executing grml-lang when Grml is
already running. Usage examples:</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
grml lang=de      # enter this at the bootprompt and you will get
                  # german keyboard layout and german $LANG, $LC_ALL,
                  # $LANGUAGE...
grml keyboard=de xkeyboard=de lang=at # enter this at the bootprompt
                  # and you will get german keyboard and austrian
                  # language variables
% grml-lang de    # enter this in the shell to switch keyboard layout
                  # and $LANG settings in a running Grml system
</pre>

<p>Note: run grml-setlang to get a dialog based frontend for
/etc/default/locale. Run grml-setkeyboard to get a dialog
based frontend for /etc/sysconfig/keyboard.</p>

<h3><a name="wms"></a><a href="#toc">Which window managers can I use?</a></h3>

<p>Starting with the 2011.12 release Grml provides <a
href="http://www.fluxbox.org/">Fluxbox</a>Â as window manager.</p>

<h3><a name="lvm"></a><a href="#toc">Where are my LVM devices?</a></h3>

<p>LVM (Logival Volumes) is <strong>not</strong> started by default to
avoid any possible damage to your data. To get access to present LVM
devices just execute:</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
# /etc/init.d/lvm2 start
</pre>

<p>If you want to enable LVM by default just boot using the 'lvm'
bootoption which automatically enables LVM.</p>

<h3><a name="swraid"></a><a href="#toc">Where are my Software-RAID devices?</a></h3>

<p>Software-RAID (usually known as the mdadm stuff) is
<strong>not</strong> started by default to avoid any possible damage to
your data. To get access to present SW-RAID devices just execute:</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
# /etc/init.d/mdadm-raid start
</pre>

<p>If you want to enable SW-RAID by default just boot using
the 'swraid' bootoption which enables automatic assembling of
software raid arrays.</p>

<a name="terminalserver"></a>

<h3><a name="booting"></a><a href="#toc">Which ways exist to boot Grml?</a></h3>

<!-- TODO: needs rework -->

<p>Of course running from CD/DVD is a common way to boot
Grml. But Grml provides many more ways to boot:</p>

<p>It is possible to boot Grml via USB (e.g. USB stick or
harddisk), firewire, or running from a Compact Flash disk. It
works out of the box; you don't need to modify anything. Check
out <a href="https://github.com/grml/grml/wiki/usb">the usb
webpage in the grml-wiki</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Your computer can not boot from CD-ROM but provides a
floppy disk? Take a look
at <a href="http://btmgr.sourceforge.net/">btmgr</a>, <a href="http://ubcd4win.com/faq.htm#floppy">ubcd4win</a>
or <a href="http://linux.simple.be/tools/sbm">sbm</a>. They
provide support for booting from CD-ROM via a special floppy
disk.</p>

<p>grml-terminalserver makes it possible to boot your system
via network
using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment">PXE</a>
(Preboot Execution Environment). If your network card does not
provide support for booting via PXE you can still boot it
either using the provided grub image by grml-terminalserver
(for example via floppy drive) or
using <a href="http://etherboot.org/wiki/index.php">gPXE</a>.
For more information, refer to
the <a href="/terminalserver/">grml-terminalserver
webpage</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="timezone"></a><a href="#toc">How do I configure
timezone on my Grml system?</a></h3>

<p>Available bootoptions relevant in live-cd mode:</p>

<ul>
<li>utc: set UTC, if your system clock is set to UTC (GMT)
<li>gmt: set UTC, if your system clock is set to UTC (GMT) [like bootoption utc]
<li>tz=$option: set timezone to corresponding $option, usage example:
tz=Europe/Vienna
</ul>

<p>Further information: manpages hwclock(8), tzselect(1) and tzconfig(8); <a
href="http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/system-administrator/ch-sysadmin-time.html">Debian
GNU/Linux System Administrator's Manual Chapter 16 - Time</a> and <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/TimeZoneChanges">TimeZoneChanges in the
Debian-Wiki</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="hdinstall"></a><a href="#toc">Is it possible to install Grml to harddisk?</a></h3>

<p>Short anwer: No.</p>

<p>If you want to get a plain Debian system take a look at <a
href="/grml-debootstrap/">grml-debootstrap</a>.</p>

<p>Long(er) answer: yes it's possible to install Grml. But it's not
supported and you'll be on your own. That's why we decided to make it
not-so-obvious. If you really know what you're doing you'll find out on
your own. Reminder: use <a
href="/grml-debootstrap/">grml-debootstrap</a> or <a
href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian Installer</a> instead.</p>

<h2><a name="software"></a><a href="#toc">Software</a></h2>

<h3><a name="sw_version"></a><a href="#toc">Which package(s) and which
version is available?</a></h3>

<p>If you want to get details about the provided packages and the
package versions without booting the Grml ISO check out the dpkg_...
files in the <a href="/files/#debian">Debian-Information section on
grml.org/files/</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="zsh"></a><a href="#toc">Why is Zsh the default shell?</a></h3>

<p>Short answer: because <a href="/zsh/">Zsh rocks</a>, really!</p>

<p>Long(er) answer: If you don't know Zsh take a look the <a
href="/zsh/">Grml Zsh reference card</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a Bash user and don't know Zsh yet, don't be
afraid. Bash is largely a subset of Zsh and you don't have to
throw away your knowledge about shell stuff.</p>
