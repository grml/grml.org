<h3><a name="whatis"></a><a href="#toc">What is Grml?</a></h3>

<p>Grml is a bootable live system (Live-CD) based
on <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>. It is not
necessary to install anything to a harddisk. Grml includes a
collection of GNU/Linux software especially for system
administrators. It specializes on administrative tasks like
installation, deployment and system rescue.</p>

<h3><a name="flavours"></a><a href="#toc">What architectures are supported by Grml?</a></h3>

The currently supported architectures are:

* `amd64`: 64-bit x86 PCs (both AMD and Intel CPUs, despite the name)
* `arm64`: 64-bit ARM

<h3><a name="grml32"></a><a href="#toc">What were grml32, grml64 and grml96?</a></h3>

Up to Grml release 2024.02, these three flavours were offered (for full and small each):

<ul>
    <li>grml32-full: version for 32-bit x86 PCs (kernel and userspace)</li>
    <li>grml64-full: version for 64-bit x86 PCs version (kernel and userspace)</li>
    <li>grml96-full: multi boot version (featuring the grml32-full and grml64-full ISOs combined on one ISO)</li>
</ul>

It was <em>strongly</em> encouraged to use either the grml64 or the grml96 flavours.

Since Grml release 2024.12, the grml32 flavour (for 32-bit x86 PCs) as well as the grml96 flavours no longer exist.

A new naming convention was introduced to include the architecture and version information, being `grml-$FLAVOUR-$VERSION-$ARCH`.

What was formerly known as `grml64` is now known as `grml-*-amd64`.
You will see, for example, `grml-full-2024.12-amd64.iso`, where `amd64` indicates this ISO is for an 64-bit x86 PC.

<h3><a name="grml32download"></a><a href="#toc">Where can I download grml32?</a></h3>

Grml32 (the 32-bit x86 PCs flavour of Grml) <a href="#grml32">is no longer supported</a>.
If you're looking for the latest available version of grml32, the following ISOs are available:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://archive.grml.org/grml32-full_2024.02.iso">grml32-full_2024.02.iso</a> (859MB, sha256: 61bb2c27e4f0946944fcb883bea1674275cdf2f1303a7bdef58758a3c2d62c4b)</li>
<li><a href="https://archive.grml.org/grml32-small_2024.02.iso">grml32-small_2024.02.iso</a> (458MB, sha256: 9614340254024ef0e89dcf57fd3d385a87ada27ec2015bf800784816e0e02bc4)</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="grmlsmall"></a><a href="#toc">What is the difference between grml-full and grml-small?</a></h3>

grml-small provides a reduced set of available software compared to grml-full, for example it doesn't provide the X.org window system.
It provides the same Linux kernel image as grml-full and is fully binary compatible.
Choose the grml-small flavour if size - for whatever reason - really matters to you.

<h3><a name="get"></a><a href="#toc">Where do I get Grml?</a></h3>

Grml is open source, you can download it from the mirrors listed at [grml.org/download/](/download/).

<h3><a name="whatmeans"></a><a href="#toc">What does Grml mean?</a></h3>

Grml comes close to "argl" or "grrr" in English.
People use this when they want to express their dissatisfaction with software (amongst other things).

<h3><a name="releasename"></a><a href="#toc">What about the release name?</a></h3>
{{< require_release_update "2025.08" >}}

Codename of Grml 2025.08 is "Oneinonein".

Make your own choice if you read it as one-in-one-in, or O-Nein-o-Nein! (In German: oh no, oh no!)

<h3><a name="requirements"></a><a href="#toc">Requirements for running Grml</a></h3>

* 64-bit x86 CPU (Intel Prescott or later, or AMD K8 or later, in 64-bit mode)
* or 64-bit ARM CPUs (v8)
* at least 1GB RAM. Preferably more
* either a [USB-boot capable system](#usbboot), a bootable CD-/DVD-ROM drive, or a network card for booting via network/PXE (check out [grml-terminalserver](#terminalserver))

<h3><a name="accessibility"></a><a href="#toc">What does accessibility at Grml mean?</a></h3>

The Grml kernel includes support for speakup.
For software, brltty and espeakup are included in grml-full.

<h3><a name="bootoptions"></a><a href="#toc">Which boot options does Grml support?</a></h3>

Check out the [grml-cheatcodes file](https://grml.org/cheatcodes/) (also available via [grml.org/cheatcodes/](/cheatcodes/)).

Of course [the command-line parameters](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html) of the Linux kernel applies to Grml as well.

<h3><a name="systemd"></a><a href="#toc">Why is Grml using systemd?</a></h3>

We're a modern Linux distribution.

<h3><a name="known_issues"></a><a href="#toc">Are there any known issues? How about reporting bugs?</a></h3>

<p>Please visit the <a href="/bugs/">bug webpage</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="features"></a><a href="#toc">Features</a></h2>

<!-- TODO: needs to be improved! -->
<h3><a name="usbboot"></a><a href="#toc">How do I boot Grml from a USB stick?</a></h3>

You can directly "dd" our ISOs to an empty USB stick/key, like this:

<pre class="rahmen">
dd bs=4M status=progress if=grml-full-{{< param current_release.version >}}-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdX           # OVERWRITES /dev/sdX!
</pre>

where /dev/sdX is your USB device. **Warning:** all previously stored data on the USB device will be lost.

For more flexibility, please check out our [grml2usb tool](/grml2usb/) and its manual.

On our wiki, you will find additional background information on [booting from USB](https://github.com/grml/grml/wiki/usb).
On modern PCs, both `dd` and `grml2usb` just work.

<h3><a name="store"></a><a name="persistency"></a><a href="#toc">Is it possible to store my settings?</a></h3>

<p>Yes, using the
<a href="https://github.com/grml/grml/wiki/persistency">persistency
feature</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="password"></a><a href="#toc">What are the passwords of users on Grml?</a></h3>

There are no default passwords - all accounts are locked by default for security reasons.
Even local logins are not possible (unless you set a password or create new user accounts as root).
You can create valid passwords using `sudo passwd [username]` from the shell individually.

With the [boot option](#bootoptions) `ssh` a password for the users `root` and `grml` is generated and SSH login is enabled.

<h3><a name="version"></a><a href="#toc">How do I find out the version of Grml</a></h3>

Run `grml-version` or use the following command:

<pre class="rahmen">
$ cat /etc/grml_version
</pre>

<h3><a name="language"></a><a href="#toc">How do I change the language/keyboard layout?</a></h3>

The default language of the Grml system is English (`en_US.UTF-8`).
All other locales are removed by default.

But it is possible to change the keyboard layout via either using `grml-quickconfig`, the [boot option(s)](#bootoptions) `lang`, `keyboard` and `xkeyboard` or via executing grml-lang when Grml is already running.

Boot option examples:

<pre class="rahmen">
grml lang=de      # enter this at the bootprompt and you will get
                  # german keyboard layout and german $LANG, $LC_ALL,
                  # $LANGUAGE...
grml keyboard=de xkeyboard=de lang=at # enter this at the bootprompt
                  # and you will get german keyboard and austrian
                  # language variables
</pre>

`grml-lang` example:

<pre class="rahmen">
% grml-lang de    # enter this in the shell to switch keyboard layout
</pre>

Note: Run `grml-setlang` to get a dialog based frontend for `/etc/default/locale`.

<h3><a name="wms"></a><a href="#toc">Which window managers can I use?</a></h3>

Grml provides [Fluxbox](http://www.fluxbox.org/) as window manager on grml-full.

<h3><a name="lvm"></a><a href="#toc">Where are my LVM devices?</a></h3>

LVM (Logical Volume Manager) is **not** started by default to avoid any possible damage to your data.

To activate present LVM devices execute (replace "$name" with the name of the PV):

<pre class="rahmen">
# Start lvm2-pvscan@$name
</pre>

or if you don't know its name and to enable all present ones, use:

<pre class="rahmen">
# vgchange -ay
</pre>

If you want to enable LVM by default just boot using the `lvm` [boot option](#bootoptions) which automatically enables LVM.

<h3><a name="swraid"></a><a href="#toc">Where are my Software-RAID devices?</a></h3>

Software-RAID (usually known as the mdadm stuff) is **not** started by default to avoid any possible damage to your data.

To get access to present SW-RAID devices execute:

<pre class="rahmen">
# mdadm --asssemble --scan
</pre>

If you want to enable SW-RAID by default just boot using the `swraid` [boot option](#bootoptions) which enables automatic assembling of software raid arrays.

<a name="terminalserver"></a>
<h3><a name="booting"></a><a href="#toc">Which ways exist to boot Grml?</a></h3>

Of course booting from CD/DVD is still supported.
But Grml provides more ways to boot:

The most common option to boot Grml is from a USB stick.
It works out of the box; you don't need to modify anything.
Check out [the entry on USB boot](#usbboot) for more details.

grml-terminalserver makes it possible to boot your system via network
using [PXE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment)
(Preboot Execution Environment).
If your network card does not provide support for booting via PXE you can
still boot it either using the provided grub image by grml-terminalserver
or using [iPXE](https://ipxe.org/).

For more information, refer to the [grml-terminalserver webpage](/terminalserver/).

<h3><a name="timezone"></a><a href="#toc">How do I configure timezone on my Grml system?</a></h3>

Availabe boot options:

<pre class="rahmen">
grml utc          # set UTC, if your system/hardware clock is set to UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)
grml localtime    # Hardware Clock is set to local time (LOCAL), this is the default
grml tz=$option   # set timezone to corresponding $option, usage example: tz=Europe/Vienna, defaults to UTC if unset
</pre>

Further information: manpages hwclock(8), tzselect(1) and tzconfig(8);
[Debian Debian Administrator's Handbook - Time](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-handbook/sect.config-misc.en.html)
and
[TimeZoneChanges in the Debian-Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/TimeZoneChanges).

<h3><a name="hdinstall"></a><a href="#toc">Is it possible to install Grml to harddisk?</a></h3>

No.
If you want to install a Debian system take a look at [grml-debootstrap](/grml-debootstrap/)
(or use the [Debian Installer](https://www.debian.org/) instead).

<h2><a name="software"></a><a href="#toc">Software</a></h2>

<h3><a name="sw_version"></a><a href="#toc">Which package(s) and which
version is available?</a></h3>

If you want to get details about the provided packages and the
package versions without booting the Grml ISO check out the `dpkg_...`
files in the [Debian-Information section on grml.org/files/](/files/#debian).

<h3><a name="zsh"></a><a href="#toc">Why is Zsh the default shell?</a></h3>

Short answer: because [Zsh rocks](/zsh/), really!

Long(er) answer: If you don't know Zsh take a look the [Grml Zsh reference card](/zsh/).

If you are a Bash user and don't know Zsh yet, don't be afraid.
Bash is largely a subset of Zsh and you don't have to throw away your knowledge about shell stuff.
