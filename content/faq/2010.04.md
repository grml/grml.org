<h2><a name="general"></a><a href="#toc">General</a></h2>

<h3><a name="whatis"></a><a href="#toc">What is grml?</a></h3>

<p>Grml is a bootable CD (Live-CD) based on <a
href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>. Grml includes a collection of
GNU/Linux software especially for system administrators and users of
texttools. Grml provides automatic hardware detection. You can use grml
as a rescue system, for analyzing systems/networks, or as a working
environment. It is not necessary to install anything to a harddisk. Due
to on-the-fly decompression grml includes more than 2GB of software and
documentation on the CD.</p>

<h3><a name="get"></a><a href="#toc">Where do I get grml?</a></h3>

<p>Grml is open source, you can download it from the mirrors listed at
<a href="/download">grml.org/download/</a>. If you want to get an
original grml-CD including <a href="/files/#covers">the grml-cover</a>,
need a special amount of CDs or want your own special grml-CD (including
your logo, your software and/or special settings) <a
href="/contact/">please don't hesitate to contact us</a>. Take a look at
<a href="http://grml-solutions.com/">Grml Solutions</a> if you're
interested in commercial support.</p>

<h3><a name="whatmeans"></a><a href="#toc">What does grml mean?</a></h3>

<p>Grml is short for 'grummel' and comes close to 'argl' or 'grrr' in
English. People use this when they want to express their
dissatisfaction/discontentedness with software (amongst other
things):</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
$ grep -ch grml .centericq/**/history | xargs echo | \
sed 's/[0-9]*/&amp; + /g' | sed 's/+ $//g' | bc -l
3746</pre>

<h3><a name="pronounce"></a><a href="#toc">How do you pronounce grml?</a></h3>

<pre class="rahmen">
% flite -o play -t gremel</pre>
<!--
$ echo 'ghroummel' | festival \-\-tts
-->

<h3><a name="releasename"></a><a href="#toc">What about the release name?</a></h3>

<p>Codename of Grml 2010.04 is Grmlmonster. Take a look look at the <a
href="/screenshots/#grml1004">release screenshot</a> and
think of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_Street">Sesame
Street's Cookie Monster</a> (in german known as <a
href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krümelmonster#Kr.C3.BCmelmonster">Krümelmonster</a>).
</p>

<h3><a name="requirements"></a><a href="#toc">Requirements for running grml</a></h3>

<ul>

<li>Intel-compatible CPU (i586 or later, preferably Pentium class or higher)</li>

<li>grml/grml-medium: at least 64MB of RAM (for stable use with
ramdisks for aufs and udev and when running X window system we
recommend at least 128MB)</li>

<li>grml-small: at least 32MB RAM should be available</li>

<li>either a bootable CD-ROM drive or <a href="#usbboot">USB-boot
capabable system</a> (for booting via network/PXE check out <a
href="#terminalserver">grml-terminalserver</a>)</li>

</ul>

<h3><a name="why"></a><a href="#toc">Why another Linux distribution?</a></h3>

<p>There already exist &quot;<a
href="http://www.distrowatch.com/">some</a>&quot; distributions. We
decided to base our work on the existing infrastructure of <a
href="http://debian.org/">Debian</a> because we don't want to reinvent
the wheel. Some admins already use their own rescue CD, Knoppix works
but does not bring that many important tools for admins and users of
texttools out of the box. Therefor we decided to share our work with
others and provide the swiss army knife for sysadmins and texttool
fans.</p>

<h3><a name="license"></a><a href="#toc">What's the license of grml?</a></h3>

<p>Anything written by the grml team is published under the GPL (<a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public
License</a>). You don't have to pay anything for using grml. If you want
a special Live-CD or need commercial support, take a look at <a
href="http://grml-solutions.com/">Grml Solutions</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="difference"></a><a href="#toc">What's the difference between grml and
$OTHER-DISTRIBUTION? What are the main goals?</a></h3>

<p>The main goal of grml is to be a distribution well suited for
sysadmins and users of texttools. Grml includes all the tools for
admin's daily work (lvm, mdadm, dd/ddrescue,...) as well as many
important texttools (of course awk, sed, grep, ...  but also zsh,
mutt[ng], slrn, vim and many others). Grml uses the existing
infrastructure of <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>. Grml was
once based on <a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/">Knoppix</a> (see
'<a href="#knoppix">What's the difference between grml and Knoppix?</a>'
for more details). We are also merging useful things from other
distributions/live-cds to provide a perfect environment.</p>

<h3><a name="knoppix"></a><a href="#toc">What's the difference between grml and Knoppix?</a></h3>

<p>Grml comes with a vastly different set of software. Missing KDE and
OpenOffice provides the opportunity of shipping more than 800 packages
which Knoppix does not provide on its CD version. Grml boots a recent
2.6 kernel but no X by default for faster startup. Knoppix is based on
Debian/testing-experimental (using apt-pinning), but grml is basically
based on plain Debian/unstable providing more current versions of
software. Grml was once based on Knoppix but nowadays has nothing in
common with Knoppix:</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
# locate knoppix
# find / -iname \*knoppix\*
#</pre>

<p>We consider Knoppix as a brand name for live-cds nowadays and provide
most of Knoppix' features as well. Grml uses (mostly) the same <a
href="https://grml.org/cheatcodes/">cheatcodes</a>
for booting as Knoppix and even provides some extra ones. So if you are
used to the basic Knoppix features you usually find them on the
grml system as well.</p>

<h3><a name="accessibility"></a><a href="#toc">What does accessibility at grml mean?</a></h3>

<p>The Grml kernel includes <a href="/kernel/#speakup">support for
speakup</a> and provides software like brltty (using bootoption 'grml
blind brltty=type,port,tbl') and flite.</p>

<h3><a name="bootoptions"></a><a href="#toc">Which bootoptions does Grml support?</a></h3>

<p>Check out the <a
href="https://grml.org/cheatcodes/">grml-cheatcodes
file</a> (also available via <a href="/cheatcodes/">grml.org/cheatcodes/</a>). Of
course <a
href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt">kernel-parameters.txt</a>
of the Linux kernel applies to Grml as well.</p>

<h3><a name="emulation"></a><a href="#toc">Is it possible to run grml with $EMULATOR?</a></h3>

<p>Sure, Grml works with(in) several emulators and virtual environments,
like e.g.
<a href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/">KVM</a>,
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/">MS Virtual PC</a>,
<a href="http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/">QEMU</a>
<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtualbox</a> and
<a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMware</a>.
</p>

<h3><a name="usbboot"></a><a href="#toc">How do I boot grml from a USB stick?</a></h3>

<p>Check out <a
href="https://github.com/grml/grml/wiki/usb#grml2usb">grml2usb</a> at the
<a href="https://github.com/grml/grml/wiki/usb">usb webpage in the
grml-wiki.</a></p>

<h3><a name="store"></a><a href="#toc">Is it possible to store my settings?</a></h3>

<p>Yes. Grml provides a config framework, check out <a
href="/config/">grml.org/config/</a>, <a
href="file:///usr/share/doc/grml-saveconfig/grml-config.html">/usr/share/doc/grml-saveconfig/grml-config.html</a>
and 'man grml-autoconfig save-config restore-config mkpersistenthome' for more
details. Starting with release 2009.05 a <a
href="#persistency">persistency option</a> is
available.</p>

<h3><a name="persistency"></a><a href="#doc">Is a persistency feature available?</a></h3>

<p>Starting with release 2009.05 a persistency feature is available. Use
<a
href="/online-docs/live-snapshot.en.1.html">live-snapshot</a>
(man live-snapshot) and the bootoption 'persistent' for enabling
persistency.</p>

<a name="grmlmedium"></a><a name="grmlsmall"></a><a name="grml64"></a>

<h2></a><a href="#toc">grml-medium / grml-small / grml64?</a></h2>

<h3><a name="whatismedium"></a><a href="#toc">What is grml-medium?</a></h3>

<p>grml-medium is a grml-flavour which tries to close the gap between <a
href="#whatissmall">grml-small</a> and <a
href="#whatis">normal/large/full version of grml</a>. grml-medium is an
ISO with a size of ~200MB providing the most important packages a
sysadmin usually needs. It provides the same <a href="/kernel/">kernel
version</a> as normal grml does so you can easily integrate and use some
further existing external modules as well. The X.org server is shipped
as well as the window manager fluxbox. Take a look at the <a
href="/files/">'Debian-Information'-section</a> if you are searching for
the package list. <a
href="https://github.com/grml/grml/wiki/accessibility">accessibility
features</a> are <strong>NOT</strong> available/supported on grml-medium
though.</p>

<h3><a name="whatissmall"></a><a href="#toc">What is grml-small?</a></h3>

<p>Whereas grml provides about 2.3GB of software on a 700 MB ISO,
grml-small is a flavor with about 100 MB ISO-size (~275 MB
uncompressed).  It does not provide a lot of software (for example no
X.org and no man pages) but the essential stuff for being a rescue
system on a business card CD-ROM or a small USB device. You can use the
Debian package management system to install software on the fly
(assuming you have network access to a Debian mirror). It provides the
same <a href="/kernel/">kernel version</a> as normal grml does so you
can easily integrate and use some further existing external modules as
well. Take a look at the <a
href="/files/">'Debian-Information'-section</a> if you are searching for
the package list.</p>

<h3><a name="whatisgrml64"></a><a href="#toc">What is grml64?</a></h3>

<p>grml64 is a 64bit-version of grml, based on <a
href="http://www.debian.org/ports/amd64/">the amd64 port of
Debian</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="whatismedium64"></a><a href="#toc">What is grml64-medium?</a></h3>

<p>grml64-medium is the 64bit version of <a href="#whatismedium">grml-medium</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="whatissmall64">What is grml64-small?</a></h3>

<p>grml64-small is the 64bit version of <a href="#whatissmall">grml-small</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="grml64vsnormal"></a><a href="#toc">What is the difference between 32 bit grml and 64 bit grml?</a></h3>

<p>The main difference of course is that grml64 is a 64bit-version
whereas (normal) grml is 32bit-only. grml64 provides a 64bit kernel
which supports 32bit userspace applications. grml64 also provides
libc6-i386 and libc6-dev-i386.  Due to space reasons and because some
packages aren't available for amd64 (yet) some few packages are missing on
grml64 compared to (normal, 32bit) grml.</p>

<h3><a name="smallvsnormal"></a><a href="#toc">What is the
difference between 'normal' grml and grml-small?</a></h3>

<p>The 700MB-grml brings more than 2500 software packages. grml-small
includes about 300 software packages, lacks documentation and manpages
on the ISO. <a href="#terminalserver">grml-terminalserver</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/grml/grml/wiki/accessibility">accessibility
features</a> are <strong>not</strong> available/supported on
grml-small.</p>

<h3><a name="grmlvsdsl"></a><a href="#toc">What is the
difference between grml-small and DSL?</a></h3>

<p>DSL (Damns Small Linux) and grml-small have different target
audiences. <a href="http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/">Damn Small Linux</a>
(DSL) uses kernel version 2.4 whereas grml-small provides a recent
version of kernel version 2.6.  DSL provides the X window system which
grml-small does not. grml-small on the other hand provides the most
important packages for sysadmins and ships the original Debian package
management which allows you to install packages of the Debian pool with
no modifications.</p>

</ul>

<p>If you find another bug, or consider something a problem not yet
mentioned <a href="#bugreport">please it</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="hardware"></a><a href="#toc">I have problems with my hardware!</a></h3>

<p>Take a look at the script grml-hwinfo. This script generates a file
named info.tar.bz2 which contains important information about your
hardware. If you think we might help, please run grml-hwinfo and <a
href="/contact/">send us the file</a> with additional, relevant
information regarding your problem.</p>

<h3><a name="boot"></a><a href="#toc">grml does not boot on my computer!</a></h3>

<p>Please take a look at <a
href="https://grml.org/cheatcodes/">the
available bootparamters and cheatcodes</a> and '<a href="#booting">Which
ways exist to boot grml?</a>'. Especially booting with 'acpi=off noapm
noapic' might help. The bootparameter 'failsafe' provides minimal
hardware detection using some special bootoptions (please do NOT boot
with 'grml failsafe' but with 'failsafe' as first word of the boot
commandline) . If booting hangs during stage &quot;Waiting for /dev to
be fully populated&quot; please try booting with 'grml noudev'. If you
don't even see the bootsplash of the grml-ISO your BIOS might be broken
(pretty common especially on old hardware). Please consider using <a
href="http://btmgr.sourceforge.net/">btmgr</a> then for booting your
system. Also check out the <a
href="https://github.com/grml/grml/wiki/problems">problems webpage</a> in
<a href="http://wiki.grml.org/">the grml-wiki</a>. You still have
problems? Feel free to <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="fbprobs"></a><a href="#toc">I don't see anything when booting grml?!</a></h3>

<p>Likely, this is a problem with the vesafb framebuffer. Try to boot
with the 'Disable Framebuffer' menuentry (available behind the submenu
'Boot options for ...') or manually ad 'vga=normal' to the kernel
command line (press TAB to edit a menu entry and add 'vga=normal'
to it then).</p>

<h3><a name="utf8"></a><a href="#toc">I have problems with UTF-8 / Unicode</a></h3>

<p>Check out <a
href="https://github.com/grml/grml/wiki/utf8">UTF8-webpage in the
grml-wiki</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="grml2hdhang"></a><a href="#toc">grml2hd seems to hang?!</a></h3>

<p>grml2hd seems to hang? Switch to tty12 and take a look at the syslog output.
If you see something like:</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
SQUASHFS error: zlib_fs returned unexpected result 0x........
SQUASHFS error: Unable to read cache block [.....]
SQUASHFS error: Unable to read inode [.....]</pre>

<p>your ISO/CD-ROM <em>very</em> probably is NOT ok. Verify it via
booting with grml testcd if that works, or even better check your CD
low-level via running:</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
# readcd -c2scan dev=/dev/cdrom</pre>

<p>If the medium really is ok and it still fails try to boot with
DMA deactivated via 'grml nodma ide=nodma libata.dma=0' at the bootprompt.</p>

<h3><a name="missingfiles"></a><a href="#toc">I noticed some files are missing on grml</a></h3>

<p>Yes, output of 'debsums -a 1&gt;/dev/null' might output some
failures. The reason is pretty simple: some few modification have been
done either because they are required for the provided environment or
because of space limitiations on the ISO. The failures are nothing to
really care about, but as we don't hide anything we thought it might be
worth mentioning.</p>

<h3><a name="bugreport"></a><a href="#toc">Bugreport</a></h3>

<h2><a name="system"></a><a href="#toc">System</a></h2>

<h3><a name="isolinux"></a><a href="#toc">Where's the old bootsplash?</a></h3>

<p>Starting with release 2009.10 Grml provides a menu based bootsplash.
To adjust boot options just press the TAB-key. To directly switch to the
old-style isolinux cmdline just press the escape key within 30 seconds. If you
still need access to the old bootsplash layout (including the f2, f3,...
pages with further information regarding available bootoptions)
select the entry 'Isolinux prompt' in the menu based bootsplash (just
press 'i' and ENTER for direct access to it). The timeout until either
the selected entry is booted (if specified) or until the system will
restore from the cmdline to the menu based bootsplash is 30 seconds.</p>

<h3><a name="configure"></a><a href="#toc">Which tools exist to configure grml?</a></h3>

<p>Grml provides several scripts and tools which should make life
easier. See 'dpkg -L grml-scripts' to get an overview of some main
scripts. Run 'grml-config' to get a dialog interface for the most
important scripts and tasks. Or just type 'grml-' and press tab-key to
get a completion menu in the shell.</p>

<h3><a name="password"></a><a href="#toc">What are the passwords of users on grml?</a></h3>

<p>There are no default passwords - all accounts are locked by default
for security reasons. Even local logins are not possible (unless you set
a password or create new user accounts as root).  You can create valid
passwords using "sudo passwd [username]" from the shell
individually.</p>

<h3><a name="version"></a><a href="#toc">How do I find out the version of grml</a></h3>

<p>Run 'grml-version' or use the following command:</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
$ cat /etc/grml_version</pre>

<h3><a name="remove_cd"></a><a href="#toc">Is it possible to run LiveCD and eject CD-ROM?</a></h3>

<pre class="rahmen">
% sudo umount -l /live/image
% sudo eject /dev/cdrom # now don't run any new programs unless you booted using 'toram'
% mount /dev/cdrom      # mount it again if needed
</pre>

<h3><a name="language"></a><a href="#toc">How do I change the language/keyboard settings?</a></h3>

<p>By default grml uses english settings. But it is possible to
change the settings via using either the bootparam(s) lang,
keyboard and xkeyboard or via executing grml-lang when grml is
already running. Usage examples:</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
grml lang=de      # enter this at the bootprompt and you will get
            # german keyboard layout and german $LANG, $LC_ALL,
            # $LANGUAGE...
grml keyboard=de xkeyboard=de lang=at # enter this at the bootprompt
            # and you will get german keyboard and austrian
            # language variables
% grml-lang de    # enter this in the shell to switch keyboard layout
            # and $LANG settings in a running grml-system
</pre>

<p>If you are running grml from harddisk (using <a
href="#hdinstall">grml2hd</a>) you have several options how to set
language options:</p>

<ul>

<li>adjust /etc/default/locale to configure global language and
environment settings</li>

<li>set environment variables like $LC_ALL, $LANG, $LANGUAGE in your
personal configuration files (like ~/.zshrc.local, see <a
href="/zsh/">grml zsh reference card</a> for details)
if you do not want to use them system wide/global</li>

<li>adjust /etc/sysconfig/keyboard to configure keyboard layout
on console, or run 'loadkeys $KEYTABLE' manually</li>

<li>add &quot;setxkbmap $LANGUAGE&quot; to the keybindings section in
your ~/.xinitrc to configure keyboard setup for the X window system
(deactivate the xmodmap lines if necessary)</li>

</ul>

<p>Note: run grml-setlang to get a dialog based frontend for
/etc/default/locale. Run grml-setkeyboard to get a dialog based frontend
for /etc/sysconfig/keyboard.</p>

<h3><a name="kde_and_foo"></a><a href="#toc">KDE, Gnome, $FOO and $BAR</a></h3>

<p>Why isn't KDE, Gnome, $FOO or $BAR part of grml? grml is a
distribution for users of texttools and sysadmins. If you would like to
run KDE with Debian use e.g. <a href="http://sidux.com/">Sidux</a> or <a
href="http://www.kubuntu.org/">Kubuntu</a>. Gnome users might find <a
href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu</a> useful. If you would like
to see a specific (software) package added to grml please <a
href="/report/">report it to us</a>!</p>

<h3><a name="wms"></a><a href="#toc">Which window managers can I use?</a></h3>

<p>Grml is shipped only with window managers which are lightweight and
fast - so well suited for a live system. At the moment, grml provides the
following window managers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/">awesome</a>
<li><a href="http://wmii.de/dwm/">dwm</a>

<p>Tip: If you are new to grml and/or prefer an easy-to-use-desktop run 'grml-x
wm-ng' for starting fluxbox with idesk and gkrellm.</p>

<h3><a name="usbmount"></a><a href="#toc">How do I mount a USB device / USB stick?</a></h3>

<p>Run 'mount /mnt/usb-sda1' for example if you want to mount /dev/sda1.
udev on grml does multiplexing for USB block devices, so /dev/usb-sda1
(device for mountpoint /mnt/usb-sda1) is a symlink to /dev/sda1.</p>

<h3><a name="lvm"></a><a href="#toc">Where are my LVM devices?</a></h3>

<p>LVM (Logival Volumes) is <strong>not</strong> started by default to
avoid any possible damage to your data. To get access to present LVM
devices just execute:</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
# /etc/init.d/lvm2 start

or use the shorter version:

# Start lvm2
</pre>

<p>If you want to enable LVM by default just boot using the 'lvm'
bootoption which automatically enables LVM.</p>

<h3><a name="swraid"></a><a href="#toc">Where are my Software-RAID devices?</a></h3>

<p>Software-RAID (usually known as the mdadm stuff) is
<strong>not</strong> started by default to avoid any possible damage to
your data. To get access to present SW-RAID devices just execute:</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
# /etc/init.d/mdadm-raid start

or use the shorter version:

# Start mdadm-raid
</pre>

<p>If you want to enable SW-RAID by default just boot using the 'swraid'
bootoption which enables automatic assembling of software raid arrays.</p>

<h3><a name="libata"></a><a href="#toc">Why doesn't grml find my disks / doesn't boot?</a></h3>

<p>Since release 2008.11 grml uses <a
href="http://linux-ata.org/faq.html">libata</a> exclusively (so no
longer any old IDE code). Sadly some few (usually pretty old) systems
don't boot with libata-only kernels anymore. If you think you've such a
system please provide output of 'lspci' <a href="/contact/">to
us</a>.</p>

<a name="terminalserver"></a>

<h3><a name="booting"></a><a href="#toc">Which ways exist to boot grml?</a></h3>

<p>The most common way to boot grml is, of course, running from
CD-ROM, but grml provides many more ways to boot grml:</p>

<p>It is possible to boot grml via USB (e.g. USB stick or harddisk),
firewire, or running from a Compact Flash disk. It works out of the box;
you don't need to modify anything. Check out <a
href="https://github.com/grml/grml/wiki/usb">the usb webpage in the
grml-wiki</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Your computer can not boot from CD-ROM but provides a floppy
disk? Take a look at <a
href="http://btmgr.sourceforge.net/">btmgr</a>, <a
href="http://ubcd4win.com/faq.htm#floppy">ubcd4win</a> or <a
href="http://linux.simple.be/tools/sbm">sbm</a>. They provide
support for booting from CD-ROM via a special floppy disk.</p>

<p>grml-terminalserver makes it possible to boot your system via network
using <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment">PXE</a>
(Preboot Execution Environment). If your network card does not provide
support for booting via PXE you can still boot it either using the
provided grub image by grml-terminalserver (for example via floppy
drive) or using <a href="http://etherboot.org/wiki/index.php">gPXE</a>.
For more information, refer to the <a
href="/terminalserver/">grml-terminalserver webpage</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="timezone"></a><a href="#toc">How do I configure
timezone on my grml system?</a></h3>

<h4>Available bootoptions relevant in live-cd mode:</h4>

<ul>
<li>utc: set UTC, if your system clock is set to UTC (GMT)
<li>gmt: set UTC, if your system clock is set to UTC (GMT) [like bootoption utc]
<li>tz=$option: set timezone to corresponding $option, usage example: tz=Europe/Vienna
</ul>

<h4>Configuration options relevant on harddisk installation:</h4>

<p>Run:

<pre class="rahmen">
# dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
</pre>

<p>to adjust /etc/timezone and /etc/localtime according to the
provided information.</p>

<p><strong>/etc/default/rcS:</strong> set variable UTC according
to your needs, whether your system clock is set to UTC
(UTC='yes') or not (UTC='no')</p>

<p><strong>/etc/localtime:</strong> adjust zoneinfo according to
your needs:</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
# ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/$WHATEVER_YOU_WANT /etc/localtime
</pre>

<p>The zoneinfo directory contains the time zone files that were
compiled by zic. The files contain information such as rules
about DST. They allow the kernel to convert UTC UNIX time into
appropriate local dates and times. Use the zdump utility to
print current time and date (in the specified time zone).</p>

<p><strong>/etc/adjtime:</strong> This file is used e.g. by the
adjtimex function, which can smoothly adjust system time while
the system runs.</p>

<p>If you change the time (using 'date --set ...', ntpdate,...)
it is worth setting also the hardware clock to the correct
time:</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
# hwclock --systohc [--utc]
</pre>

<p>Remember to add the --utc -option if the hardware clock is set to
UTC!</p>

<h4>Still problems?</h4>

<p>Check your current settings via:</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
cat /etc/timezone
zdump /etc/localtime
echo $TZ
hwclock --show
grep hwclock /etc/runlevel.conf
grep '^UTC' /etc/default/rc
</pre>

<h3><a name="hdinstall"></a><a href="#toc">Is it possible to install grml to harddisk?</a></h3>

<p>Yes. Grml provides a tool called <a href="/grml2hd/">grml2hd</a> (see
'<a href="/grml2hd/grml2hd.html">man grml2hd</a>').  grml is developed
on a box running the grml-system itself, and we - the grml-developers -
especially like grml2hd because it gives us a working Linux box within
10 to 30 minutes.  grml2hd is perfect for prototyping: test hardware
support of Linux, test a specific setup, ... You can even use grml2hd in
a fully automatic mode without any further interaction.</p>

<p>But <strong>please note</strong>: grml2hd does <strong>NOT</strong>
provide a Linux distribution for newbies and should be installed to hard
disk only if really know what you are doing (or don't care about
maintainability, seriously). Please install grml using grml2hd only if
can answer all of the following questions with 'sure, YES':</p>

<ul>
<li>Are you used to work with Debian/unstable?
<li>Do you know how to report bugs to Debian?
<li>Are you aware of the differences between plain Debian and grml?
</ul>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: If you want to get a plain Debian system take
a look at <a href="/grml-debootstrap/">grml-debootstrap</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are using grml in a production
environment and/or use a grml2hd installation, we strongly recommend you
subscribe to <a href="/mailinglist/">the grml user mailinglist</a>!</p>

<h3><a name="init"></a><a href="#toc">Init-System</a></h3>

<p>Why is grml using runlevel 2 as default? Because runlevel 2 is 'the
textonly one' and it is Debian's default.</p>

<p>Where are all the /etc/rc#.d-directories? grml doesn't use sysv-rc
but <a href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/file-rc">file-rc</a>. This
means you can configure the init system in one single file named
/etc/runlevel.conf with your favourite editor. No symlink-hell
anymore.</p>

<h3><a name="zsh"></a><a href="#toc">Why is zsh the default shell (/bin/sh)?</a></h3>

<p>Short answer: because <a href="/zsh/">Zsh rocks</a>, really!</p>

<p>Longer answer taken from <a
href="http://zsh.sunsite.dk/FAQ/zshfaq01.html#l3">ZSH FAQ: 1.2: What is
it?</a>:</p>

<cite> Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) which of the standard shells most
resembles the Korn shell (ksh); its compatibility with the 1988 Korn shell has been
gradually increasing. It includes enhancements of many types, notably in the
command-line editor, options for customising its behaviour, filename globbing, features
to make C-shell (csh) users feel more at home and extra features drawn from tcsh
(another `custom' shell).</cite>

<p>If you don't know zsh take a look at <a
href="http://zsh.sunsite.dk/FAQ/zshfaq02.html#l9">ZSH FAQ: How does zsh
differ from ...?</a>, 'man zsh | less -p COMPATIBILITY', the <a
href="/zsh/">grml zsh reference card</a> and '<a
href="/zsh/">man zsh-lovers</a>'.</p>

<p>If you are a bash user and don't know zsh yet, don't be afraid. bash
is largely a subset of zsh and you don't have to throw away your
knowledge about shell stuff.</p>

<h3><a name="zsh_binsh"></a><a href="#toc">Wasn't zsh the /bin/sh interpreter?</a></h3>

<p>Yes, until Grml 0.6 zsh was the interpreter for /bin/sh. Starting
with release 0.7 Grml used /bin/bash as /bin/sh and nowadays /bin/dash
is used for /bin/sh (that's what  Debian does as well). The reason?
Using zsh as default /bin/sh interpreter leads to some problems,
especially since Debian does not care to support zsh as /bin/sh overall.
Take a look at <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=329288">#329288</a>
and <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=340058">#340058</a>
for example.</p>

<h3><a name="bash"></a><a href="#toc">Is a bash available?</a></h3>

<p>Grml uses <a href="#zsh">zsh</a> as the default interactive shell
but, of course, a current version of bash (and many other shells as
well) is provided by grml.</p>

<h3><a name="configuration"></a><a href="#toc">Where can I find the configuration of zsh, GNU screen,...?</a></h3>

<p>Check out <a
href="http://michael-prokop.at/blog/2007/12/22/make-console-work-comfortable/">'Make
console work comfortable'</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="truecrypt">Why isn't Truecrypt available within grml?</a></h3>

<p>Because Truecrypt is licensed under a specific license named
'TrueCrypt License' which doesn't permit us to distribute Truecrypt (since at least
license version 2.6).
See <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/legal/license">section VI/4 of the
license</a> for details. The Ubuntu version from <a
href="http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads">truecrypt.org/downloads</a> is
known to work under grml.</p>

<h3><a name="grub"></a><a href="#toc">grub does not work on my system?!</a></h3>

<p>Looks like you used mkfs.ext3 from grml but are using an old grub
version. Notice that older versions of grub do not support 256 byte
inodes on ext3, being the default in recent versions of mkfs/e2fsprogs.
More information is available at <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=463236">#463236</a>

<h2><a name="xserver"></a><a href="#toc">X-Server</a></h2>

<h3><a name="xstart"></a><a href="#toc">How do I start the X server?</a></h3>

<p>Please use 'grml-x' as user grml for starting X on the live-cd. It
generates the config file /etc/X11/xorg.conf and lets you start commands on
startup (see ~/.xinitrc). Use it, for example, via switching to TTY4 (press
Alt+F4) and run the following command to start wm-ng (window manager fluxbox
with idesk and gkrellm):</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
grml-x wm-ng</pre>

<p>If you have /etc/X11/xorg.conf already you can use 'startx' instead of
grml-x of course. Adjust ~/.xinitrc to your needs.</p>

<h3><a name="xproblem"></a><a href="#toc">X does not start on my box?!</a></h3>

<p>grml-x supports several options. If you want to set some special options
please take a look at the grml-x manpage (man grml-x). Some usage examples:</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
grml-x -module vesa fluxbox        # start fluxbox and use vesa module
grml-x -mode '800x600' fluxbox     # set resolution to 800x600 and start fluxbox
grml-x -display 8 fluxbox          # start fluxbox on display 8
grml-x -force -nostart fluxbox     # force creation of xconfig file and don't start X server
grml-x -hsync 60 fluxbox           # set horizontal frequency and start fluxbox
grml-x -hsync 60 -vsync 40 fluxbox # set horizontal and vertical sync frequencies and start fluxbox
</pre>

<h3><a name="xresolution"></a><a href="#toc">I don't like the resolution of X!</a></h3>

<p>Just run xrandr to switch the resolution during runtime of X. For
example: 'xrandr -s 1024x768'.</p>
