<h1>NAME</h1>

<p>
grmlzshrc - Grml's zsh setup
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>

<p>
<em>zsh</em> [<strong>options</strong>]...
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>
The Grml project provides a fairly exhaustive interactive setup (referred to
as <em>grmlzshrc</em> throughout this document) for the amazing unix shell zsh
(<a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net">http://zsh.sourceforge.net</a>). This is the reference manual for that
setup.
</p>
<p>
To use <em>grmlzshrc</em>, you need at least version 3.1.7 of zsh (although not all
features are enabled in every version).
</p>
<p>
<em>grmlzshrc</em> behaves differently depending on which user loads it. For the
root user (<strong>EUID</strong> == 0) only a subset of features is loaded by default. This
behaviour can be altered by setting the <strong>GRML_ALWAYS_LOAD_ALL</strong> STARTUP
VARIABLE (see below).
</p>
<p>
Users may want to keep an up-to-date version of the setup (possibly from the
git-sources) in <em>~/.zshrc</em>. If that happens on a system where the global
zshrc is also a <em>grmlzshrc</em> (but possibly an older one), you can inhibit
loading the global version by doing:
\
</p>

<pre>
echo setopt no_global_rcs &gt;&gt; ~/.zshenv
</pre>

<p>
Note, that this will disable <em>ANY</em> global files, except for the global
zshenv file.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h1>STARTUP VARIABLES</h1>

<p>
Some of the behaviour of <em>grmlzshrc</em> can be altered by setting certain shell
variables. These may be set temporarily when starting zsh like this:
\
</p>

<pre>
% GRML_DISPLAY_BATTERY=1 zsh
</pre>

<p>
Or by setting them permanently in <strong>zshrc.pre</strong> (See AUXILIARY FILES below).
</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>BATTERY</strong></dt><dd>
Deprecated. Use <strong>GRML_DISPLAY_BATTERY</strong> instead.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>COMMAND_NOT_FOUND</strong></dt><dd>
A non zero value activates a handler, which is called when a command can not
be found. The handler is defined by GRML_ZSH_CNF_HANDLER (see below).
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>GRML_COMP_CACHING</strong></dt><dd>
If set to <em>yes</em> (the default), the setup will enable zsh's completion caching
mechanism, with the caching data being placed into <em>$GRML_COMP_CACHE_DIR</em>.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>GRML_COMP_CACHE_DIR</strong></dt><dd>
This defines where zsh's completion caching data will be placed, if
<em>$GRML_COMP_CACHING</em> is active. The default is <em>${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.cache</em>.
The setup will ensure the directory exists before attempting to use it.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>GRML_DISPLAY_BATTERY</strong></dt><dd>
If set to a value greater than zero, <em>grmlzshrc</em> will put the battery status
into the right hand side interactive prompt. Supported OSes are <em>GNU/Linux</em>,
<em>FreeBSD</em>, <em>OpenBSD</em> and <em>Darwin</em>.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>GRML_ZSH_CNF_HANDLER</strong></dt><dd>
This variable contains the handler to be used by COMMAND_NOT_FOUND (see above)
and defaults to "/usr/share/command-not-found/command-not-found".
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>GRML_NO_APT_ALIASES</strong></dt><dd>
A non-empty value inhibits the definition of apt-specific short aliases,
such as ag, agi, ati etc.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>GRML_NO_SMALL_ALIASES</strong></dt><dd>
A non-empty value inhibits the definition of 2-letter aliases such as da.
ls, ll, la and other common ls-related aliases are exempt from this, as are
the aliases inhibited by GRML_NO_APT_ALIASES.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>GRMLSMALL_SPECIFIC</strong></dt><dd>
Set this to zero to remove items in zsh config, which do not work in
grml-small.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>HISTFILE</strong></dt><dd>
Where zsh saves the history. Default: ${HOME}/.zsh_history.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>HISTSIZE</strong></dt><dd>
Number of commands to be kept in the history. On a Grml-CD this defaults to
500, on a hard disk installation to 5000.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>MAILCHECK</strong></dt><dd>
Sets the frequency in seconds for zsh to check for new mail. Defaults to 30.
A value of zero turns off checking.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>NOCOR</strong></dt><dd>
Non zero values deactivate automatic correction of commands.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>NOMENU</strong></dt><dd>
If set to zero (default), allows selection from a menu, if there are at least
five possible options of completion.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>NOPRECMD</strong></dt><dd>
A non zero value disables precmd and preexec commands. These are functions
that are run before every command (setting xterm/screen titles etc.).
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>REPORTTIME</strong></dt><dd>
Show time (user, system and cpu) used by external commands, if they run longer
than the defined number of seconds (default: 5).
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SAVEHIST</strong></dt><dd>
Number of commands to be stored in ${HISTFILE}. Defaults to 1000 on a Grml-CD
and to 10000 on an installation on hard disk.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>watch</strong></dt><dd>
As in tcsh(1) an array of login/logout events to be reported by the shell
builtin "log". For details see zshparam(1). Defaults to (notme root).
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ZSH_NO_DEFAULT_LOCALE</strong></dt><dd>
Import "/etc/default/locale", if set to zero (default).
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ZSH_PROFILE_RC</strong></dt><dd>
A non zero value causes shell functions to be profiled. The results can be
obtained with the zprof builtin command (see zshmodules(1) for details).
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>COMPDUMPFILE</strong></dt><dd>
Specifies the location of the completion dump file. Default: $HOME/.zcompdump.
</dd>
</dl>

<h1>GRML-ZSHRC SPECIFIC STYLES</h1>

<p>
Styles are a context sensitive configuration mechanism included with zsh. The
shell uses it extensively in sub-systems like the completion and the VCS info
system. It lives outside of the classic shell variable namespace, so it avoids
polluting it. New functionality in grml's zshrc will likely use styles instead
of variables. Some features of the setup (like the directory stack handling)
already use styles. Those styles are documented with the specific features.
This section documents more general styles.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Context: :grml:completion:compinit</h2>

<p>
This context revolves around the zshrc's <em>compinit</em> function call, that
initialises zsh's function based completion system.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>arguments</strong></dt><dd>
This style allows the injection of arguments to the command line that is used
to run compinit. It is a list style and its default is the empty list. Using
this style, it's possible to add <strong>-i</strong> to <em>compinit</em> in order to disable
<em>compaudit</em>.
\

<pre>
zstyle ':grml:completion:compinit' arguments -i
</pre>

\
Only do this, if you know what sort of security checks are disabled if
<em>compaudit</em> is not active and if that's acceptable with your specific setup.
\
This style has to be set at the point that Grml's zshrc runs <em>compinit</em>. A
possible way to achieve this is to set it in <em>~/.zshrc.pre</em> (see AUXILIARY
FILES below for details).
</dd>
</dl>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<h1>FEATURE DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>
This is an in depth description of non-standard features implemented by
<em>grmlzshrc</em>.
</p>

<section>
<h2>DIRSTACK HANDLING</h2>

<p>
The dirstack in <em>grmlzshrc</em> has a persistent nature. It is stored into a
file each time zsh's working directory is changed. That file can be configured
via the <strong>DIRSTACKFILE</strong> variable and it defaults to <strong>~/.zdirs</strong>. The
<strong>DIRSTACKSIZE</strong> variable defaults to <strong>20</strong> in this setup.
</p>
<p>
The <strong>DIRSTACKFILE</strong> is loaded each time zsh starts, therefore freshly started
zshs inherit the dirstack of the zsh that most recently updated
<strong>DIRSTACKFILE</strong>.
</p>
<p>
If you would like to <em>disable</em> the persistent dirstack feature altogether,
you can do that by setting the boolean <em>enable</em> style to <em>false</em> in the
right context (the default is <em>true</em>):
\
</p>

<pre>
zstyle ':grml:chpwd:dirstack' enable false
</pre>

<p>
It is possible to apply a filter to the names of directories that will be
committed to the persistent dirstack file. There are two ways to configure this
filter: A general function based filter and a pattern based filter. Both are
setup via styles in the <strong>':grml:chpwd:dirstack'</strong> context.
</p>
<p>
To use a function based filter set the <em>filter</em> style for that context to the
name of a function to call every time a directory name is to be added to the
persistent dirstack. If the function's return value signals success (ie. return
value "0"), the directory name is filtered out and <strong>not</strong> added to the
persistent stack. Example:
\
</p>

<pre>
function my_dirstack_filter() { [[ $1 == /tmp(|/*) ]] }
zstyle ':grml:chpwd:dirstack' filter my_dirstack_filter
</pre>

<p>
The pattern based filter uses a list of patterns passed to the <em>exclude</em>
style in the aforementioned context. Each pattern is tested and the first that
matches will keep the directory name from being added to the persistent stack.
If none of the patterns matches, the name is added. example:
\
</p>

<pre>
zstyle ':grml:chpwd:dirstack' exclude "/tmp(|/*)" "$HOME/tmp(|/*)"
</pre>

<p>
The function based filter is more general, the pattern based filter easier to
set up. If both filter variants are used at the same time, the function based
filter will be executed <em>before</em> the pattern based one.
</p>
<p>
If you would like to apply your filters while <em>loading</em> the persistent
dirstack file, set the <em>filter-on-load</em> boolean style (the default is
<em>false</em>):
\
</p>

<pre>
zstyle ':grml:chpwd:dirstack' filter-on-load true
</pre>

<p>
Setting the <em>filter-on-load</em> and <em>enable</em> styles needs to be done in
".zshrc.pre" because the styles need to be set when the main setup is
executing! The other styles do not have this limitation, but enabling the
system as well as the initial filtering will obviously be done using settings
and filters that are configured <strong>at</strong> <strong>that</strong> <strong>point</strong>.
</p>
<p>
With respect to <em>filter-on-load</em>, the rule of thumb is: If you want to filter
on load, setup everything in ".zshrc.pre" otherwise ".zshrc.local" works just
as well.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2>DIRECTORY BASED PROFILES</h2>

<p>
If you need to perform certain actions each time you enter certain
directory-trees, this is the feature you are looking for.
</p>

<section>
<h3>Initialisation</h3>

<p>
To initialise the system, you need to call the function `chpwd_profiles' at
some point in your `zshrc.local'; preferably <strong>after</strong> you configured the
system. The configuration of the system is described further below.
</p>
<p>
If you need to do initialisations the first time `chpwd_profiles' is called
(which should be in your configuration file), you can do that in a function
called "chpwd_profiles_init". That function needs to be defined <strong>before</strong>
`chpwd_profiles' is called for this to work.
</p>
<p>
During the <strong>first</strong> call of `chpwd_profiles' (and therefore all its profile
functions) the parameter `$CHPWD_PROFILES_INIT' exists and is set to `1'. In
all other cases, the parameter does not exist at all.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h3>Styles and Profile-names</h3>

<p>
To store its configuration, the system uses <strong>functions</strong> and <strong>styles</strong>
(zsh's context sensitive configuration system), such as this:
</p>
<p>
\
</p>

<pre>
zstyle ':chpwd:profiles:/usr/src/grml(|/|/*)'   profile grml
zstyle ':chpwd:profiles:/usr/src/debian(|/|/*)' profile debian
</pre>

<p>
When that's done and you enter a directory that matches the pattern in the
third part of the context, a function called chpwd_profile_grml, for example,
is called (if it exists).
</p>
<p>
If no pattern matches (read: no profile is detected) the profile is set to
'default', which means chpwd_profile_default is attempted to be called.
</p>
<p>
A word about the context (the ':chpwd:profiles:*' stuff in the zstyle command)
which is used: The third part in the context is matched against ${PWD}. That's
why using a pattern such as /foo/bar(|/|/*) makes sense. Because that way the
profile is detected for all these values of ${PWD}:
\
</p>

<pre>
  /foo/bar
  /foo/bar/
  /foo/bar/baz
</pre>

<p>
So, if you want to make double damn sure a profile works in /foo/bar and
everywhere deeper in that tree, just use (|/|/*) and be happy.
</p>
<p>
The name of the detected profile will be available in a variable called
'profile' in your functions. You don't need to do anything, it'll just be
there.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h3>Controlling Profile Execution</h3>

<p>
During its initialisation run, the system creates a parameter $CHPWD_PROFILE,
which is set to the profile that was is currently active (the default value is
"default"). That way you can avoid running code for a profile that is already
active, by running code such as the following at the start of your function:
\
</p>

<pre>
function chpwd_profile_grml() {
    [[ ${profile} == ${CHPWD_PROFILE} ]] &amp;&amp; return 1
  ...
}
</pre>

<p>
If you know you are going to do that all the time for each and every
directory-profile function you are ever going to write, you may also set the
`re-execute' style to `false' (which only defaults to `true' for backwards
compatibility), like this:
\
</p>

<pre>
  zstyle ':chpwd:profiles:*' re-execute false
</pre>

</section>
<section>
<h3>Signaling availabily/profile changes</h3>

<p>
If you use this feature and need to know whether it is active in your current
shell, there are several ways to do that. Here are two simple ways:
</p>
<p>
a) If knowing if the profiles feature is active when zsh starts is good
enough for you, you can use the following snippet:
</p>
<p>
(( ${+functions[chpwd_profiles]} )) &amp;&amp; print "directory profiles active"
</p>
<p>
b) If that is not good enough, and you would prefer to be notified whenever a
profile changes, you can solve that by making sure you start <strong>every</strong>
profile function you create like this:
</p>
<p>
function chpwd_profile_myprofilename() {
    [[ ${profile} == ${CHPWD_PROFILE} ]] &amp;&amp; return 1
    print "chpwd(): Switching to profile: $profile"
  ...
}
</p>
<p>
That makes sure you only get notified if a profile is <strong>changed</strong>, not
everytime you change directory. (To avoid this, you may also set the newer
`re-execute' style like described further above instead of the test on top of
the function.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h3>Leaving Profiles</h3>

<p>
When the system switches from one profile to another, it executes a function
named "chpwd_leave_profile_&lt;PREVIOUS-PROFILE-NAME&gt;()" before calling the
profile-function for the new profile.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h3>Version requirement</h3>

<p>
This feature requires zsh <em>4.3.3</em> or newer.
</p>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<h2>ACCEPTLINE WRAPPER</h2>

<p>
The <em>accept-line</em> wiget is the one that is taking action when the <strong>return</strong>
key is hit. <em>grmlzshrc</em> uses a wrapper around that widget, which adds new
functionality.
</p>
<p>
This wrapper is configured via styles. That means, you issue commands, that look
like:
\
</p>

<pre>
zstyle 'context' style value
</pre>

<p>
The context namespace, that we are using is 'acceptline'. That means, the actual
context for your commands look like: <strong>':acceptline:&lt;subcontext&gt;'</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Where <strong>&lt;subcontext&gt;</strong> is one of: <strong>default</strong>, <strong>normal</strong>, <strong>force</strong>, <strong>misc</strong>
or <strong>empty</strong>.
</p>

<section>
<h3>Recognized Contexts</h3>

<dl>
<dt><strong>default</strong></dt><dd>
This is the value, the context is initialized with.
The <em>compwarnfmt and //rehash</em> styles are looked up in this context.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>normal</strong></dt><dd>
If the first word in the command line is either a command, alias, function,
builtin or reserved word, you are in this context.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>force</strong></dt><dd>
This is the context, that is used if you hit enter again, after being warned
about the existence of a _completion for the non-existing command you
entered.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>empty</strong></dt><dd>
This is the context, you are in if the command line is empty or only
consists of whitespace.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>misc</strong></dt><dd>
This context is in effect, if you entered something that does not match any
of the above. (e.g.: variable assignments).
</dd>
</dl>

</section>
<section>
<h3>Available Styles</h3>

<dl>
<dt><strong>nocompwarn</strong></dt><dd>
If you set this style to true, the warning about non existent commands,
for which completions exist will not be issued. (Default: <strong>false</strong>)
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>compwarnfmt</strong></dt><dd>
The message, that is displayed to warn about the _completion issue.
(default: <strong>'%c will not execute and completion %f exists.'</strong>)
'%c' is replaced by the command name, '%f' by the completion's name.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>rehash</strong></dt><dd>
If this is set, we'll force rehashing, if appropriate. (Defaults to
<strong>true</strong> in <em>grmlzshrc</em>).
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>actions</strong></dt><dd>
This can be a list of wigdets to call in a given context. If you need a
specific order for these to be called, name them accordingly. The default value
is an <strong>empty list</strong>.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>default_action</strong></dt><dd>
The name of a widget, that is called after the widgets from 'actions'.
By default, this will be '.accept-line' (which is the built-in accept-line
widget).
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>call_default</strong></dt><dd>
If true in the current context, call the widget in the 'default_action'
style. (The default is <strong>true</strong> in all contexts.)
</dd>
</dl>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<h2>PROMPT</h2>

<p>
The <em>grmlzshrc</em> now supplies three prompt themes compatible with zsh's
<strong>promptinit</strong> system. The three themes are called <strong>grml</strong>, <strong>grml-large</strong> and
<strong>grml-chroot</strong>.
</p>
<p>
By default, <strong>grml</strong> is used, unless <em>$GRMLPROMPT</em> is set to a value larger
than zero, in which case <strong>grml-large</strong> is used. Lastly, if <em>$GRML_CHROOT</em> is
non-empty, <strong>grml-chroot</strong> is used.
</p>
<p>
As usual, with promptinit themes, the user may switch to a different theme using
the <em>prompt</em> utility:
\
</p>

<pre>
    prompt grml-large
</pre>

<p>
That will use the <strong>grml-large</strong> prompt theme.
</p>
<p>
The themes are highly customisable. The main source of documentation about
customisation is the main <strong>grml</strong> theme's doc-string, that is available via
the following command:
\
</p>

<pre>
    prompt -h grml
</pre>

<p>
The other themes also come with doc-strings, but the main theme's is the
canonical reference about all of them.
</p>
<p>
This feature requires version <em>4.3.7</em> of the shell. Older versions will use
the classic grml prompt as a fallback.
</p>
<p>
A note to people who like customisation: If you are <strong>not</strong> using a prompt
theme for your customisation, but you're either statically setting $PS1 (or
$PROMPT) or you're constructing one of those variables in zsh's \`precmd()'
function, make sure you are turning the zsh's prompt theme system <strong>off</strong>
before doing so. A correct example customisation could look like this:
\
</p>

<pre>
    # Turn the prompt system off:
    prompt off
    # Customise the prompt yourself:
    PS1='%~ %# '
</pre>

<p>
You also add your own tokens by using the \`grml_theme_add_token()' function.
Call the function without arguments for detailed documentation about that
procedure.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2>GNU/SCREEN STATUS SETTING</h2>

<p>
<em>grmlzshrc</em> sets screen's hardstatus lines to the currently running command
or <strong>'zsh'</strong> if the shell is idling at its prompt. If the current working
directory is inside a repository unter version control, screen status is set
to: <strong>'zsh: &lt;repository name&gt;'</strong> via zsh's vcs_info.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2>PERSISTENT HISTORY</h2>

<p>
If you got commands you consider important enough to be included in every
shell's history, you can put them into $GRML_IMPORTANT_COMMANDS (which defaults
for backward compatibility to ~/.important_commands) and they will be available
via the usual history lookup widgets.
</p>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<h1>REFERENCE</h1>

<section>
<h2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h2>

<p>
<em>grmlzshrc</em> sets some environment variables, which influence the
behaviour of applications.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>COLORTERM</strong></dt><dd>
Set to "yes". Some applications read this to learn about properties
of the terminal they are running in.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EDITOR</strong></dt><dd>
If not already set, sets the default editor. Falls back to vi(1),
if vim(1) is not available.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>LESS_TERMCAP_*</strong></dt><dd>
Some environment variables that add colour support to less(1) for viewing
man pages. See termcap(5) for details.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>MAIL</strong></dt><dd>
The mailbox file for the current user is set to /var/mail/$USER, if not
already set otherwise.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PAGER</strong></dt><dd>
Set less(1) as default pager, if not already set to something different.
</dd>
</dl>

</section>
<section>
<h2>OPTIONS</h2>

<p>
Apart from zsh's default options, <em>grmlzshrc</em> sets some options
that change the behaviour of zsh. Options that change Z-shell's default
settings are marked by &lt;grml&gt;. But note, that zsh's defaults vary depending
on its emulation mode (csh, ksh, sh, or zsh). For details, see zshoptions(1).
</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>append_history</strong></dt><dd>
Zsh sessions, that use <em>grmlzshrc</em>, will append their history list to the
history file, rather than replace it. Thus, multiple parallel zsh sessions
will all have the new entries from their history lists added to the history
file, in the order that they exit. The file will still be periodically
re-written to trim it when the number of lines grows 20% beyond the value
specified by $SAVEHIST.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>auto_cd</strong> &lt;grml&gt;</dt><dd>
If a command is issued that can't be executed as a normal command, and the
command is the name of a directory, perform the cd command to that directory.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>auto_pushd</strong> &lt;grml&gt;</dt><dd>
Make cd push the old directory onto the directory stack.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>completeinword</strong> &lt;grml&gt;</dt><dd>
If the cursor is inside a word, completion is done from both ends;
instead of moving the cursor to the end of the word first and starting
from there.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>extended_glob</strong> &lt;grml&gt;</dt><dd>
Treat the '#', '~' and '^' characters as active globbing pattern characters.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>extended_history</strong> &lt;grml&gt;</dt><dd>
Save each command's beginning timestamp (in seconds since the epoch) and the
duration (in seconds) to the history file.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>hash_list_all</strong></dt><dd>
Whenever a command completion is attempted, make sure the entire command
path is hashed first. This makes the first completion slower.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>histignorealldups</strong> &lt;grml&gt;</dt><dd>
If a new command line being added to the history list duplicates an
older one, the older command is removed from the list, even if it is
not the previous event.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>histignorespace</strong> &lt;grml&gt;</dt><dd>
Remove command lines from the history list when the first character on
the line is a space, or when one of the expanded aliases contains a
leading space. Note that the command lingers in the internal history

else was written out by another shell, and if so it is included in the
history of the current shell too. Using !-style history, the commands from
the other sessions will not appear in the history list unless you explicitly
type the "history" command. This option is activated for zsh versions &gt;= 4,
only.

<h2>KEYBINDINGS</h2>

<p>
Apart from zsh's default key bindings, <em>grmlzshrc</em> comes with its own set of
key bindings. Note that bindings like <strong>ESC-e</strong> can also be typed as <strong>ALT-e</strong>
on PC keyboards.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>ESC-e</strong></dt><dd>
Edit the current command buffer in your favourite editor.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ESC-v</strong></dt><dd>
Deletes a word left of the cursor; seeing '/' as additional word separator.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>CTRL-x-1</strong></dt><dd>
Jump right after the first word.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>CTRL-x-M()</strong></dt><dd>
Create directory under cursor or the selected area.
To select an area press ctrl-@ and use the cursor.
Use case: you type "mv abc ~/testa/testb/testc/" and remember that the
directory does not exist yet -&gt; press <strong>CTRL-xM</strong> and problem solved.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>CTRL-x-p</strong></dt><dd>
Searches the last occurrence of string before the cursor in the command history.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>CTRL-x-z</strong></dt><dd>
Display help on keybindings and zsh line editor. Press consecutively to page through content.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>CTRL-z</strong></dt><dd>
Brings a job, which got suspended with CTRL-z back to foreground.
</dd>
</dl>

<section>
<h3>Customisation</h3>

<p>
To customise keybindings, you can just use zsh's bindkey utility. However, if
you plan to use the `<em>zle-line-init</em>' or `<em>zle-line-finish</em>' hooks
yourself, make sure you call the following functions in the respective hook:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>zle-line-init</strong>: <em>zle-smkx</em>
</li>
<li><strong>zle-line-finish</strong>: <em>zle-rmkx</em>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is <strong>required</strong> so the keybindings set up by <em>grmlzshrc</em> work. The
reason for this is to turn the terminal into the right mode while zsh's line
editor (zle) is running. This enables us to query <em>terminfo</em> about escape
sequences for special keys and thus simplify and generalise our keybinding
section.

<section>
<h2>ALIASES</h2>

<p>
<em>grmlzshrc</em> comes with a wide array of predefined aliases to ease the user's
life. A few aliases (like those involving <em>grep</em> or <em>ls</em>) use the option
<em>--color=auto</em> for colourizing output. That option is part of <strong>GNU</strong>
implementations of these tools, and will only be used if such an implementation
is detected.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>acp</strong> (<em>apt-cache policy</em>)</dt><dd>
With no arguments prints out the priorities of each source. If a package name
is given, it displays detailed information about the priority selection of the
package.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>acs</strong> (<em>apt search</em>)</dt><dd>
Searches debian package lists for the regular expression provided as argument.
The search includes package names and descriptions. Prints out name and short
description of matching packages.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>acsh</strong> (<em>apt show</em>)</dt><dd>
Shows the package records for the packages provided as arguments.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>adg</strong> (<em>apt dist-upgrade</em>)</dt><dd>
Performs an upgrade of all installed packages. Also tries to automatically
handle changing dependencies with new versions of packages. As this may change
the install status of (or even remove) installed packages, it is potentially
dangerous to use dist-upgrade; invoked by sudo, if necessary.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ag</strong> (<em>apt upgrade</em>)</dt><dd>
Downloads and installs the newest versions of all packages currently installed
on the system. Under no circumstances are currently installed packages removed,
or packages not already installed retrieved and installed. New versions of
currently installed packages that cannot be upgraded without changing the install
status of another package will be left at their current version. An update must
be performed first (see au below); run by sudo, if necessary.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>agi</strong> (<em>apt install</em>)</dt><dd>
Downloads and installs or upgrades the packages given on the command line.
If a hyphen is appended to the package name, the identified package will be
removed if it is installed. Similarly a plus sign can be used to designate a
package to install. This may be useful to override decisions made by apt's
conflict resolution system.
A specific version of a package can be selected for installation by following
the package name with an equals and the version of the package to select. This
will cause that version to be located and selected for install. Alternatively a
specific distribution can be selected by following the package name with a slash
and the version of the distribution or the Archive name (stable, testing, unstable).
Gets invoked by sudo, if user id is not 0.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ati</strong> (<em>aptitude install</em>)</dt><dd>
Aptitude is a terminal-based package manager with a command line mode similar to
apt (see agi above); invoked by sudo, if necessary.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>au</strong> (<em>apt update</em>)</dt><dd>
Resynchronizes the package index files from their sources. The indexes of
available packages are fetched from the location(s) specified in
/etc/apt/sources.list. An update should always be performed before an
upgrade or dist-upgrade; run by sudo, if necessary.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>da</strong> (<em>du -sch</em>)</dt><dd>
Prints the summarized disk usage of the arguments as well as a grand total
in human readable format.
<p></p>

<h1>AUXILIARY FILES</h1>

<p>
This is a set of files, that - if they exist - can be used to customize the
behaviour of <em>grmlzshrc</em>.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>.zshrc.pre</strong></dt><dd>
Sourced at the very beginning of <em>grmlzshrc</em>. Among other things, it can
be used to permantenly change <em>grmlzshrc</em>'s STARTUP VARIABLES (see above):
\

<pre>
# show battery status in RPROMPT
GRML_DISPLAY_BATTERY=1
# always load the complete setup, even for root
GRML_ALWAYS_LOAD_ALL=1
</pre>

<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>.zshrc.local</strong></dt><dd>
Sourced right before loading <em>grmlzshrc</em> is finished. There is a global
version of this file (/etc/zsh/zshrc.local) which is sourced before the
user-specific one.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>.zdirs</strong></dt><dd>
Directory listing for persistent dirstack (see above).
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>.important_commands</strong></dt><dd>
List of commands, used by persistent history (see above).

<h1>INSTALLATION ON NON-DEBIAN SYSTEMS</h1>

<p>
On Debian systems (<a href="http://www.debian.org">http://www.debian.org</a>) - and possibly Ubuntu
(<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">http://www.ubuntu.com</a>) and similar systems - it is very easy to get
<em>grmlzshrc</em> via grml's .deb repositories.
</p>
<p>
On non-debian systems, that is not an option, but all is not lost:
\
</p>

<pre>
% wget -O .zshrc https://git.grml.org/f/grml-etc-core/etc/zsh/zshrc
</pre>

<p>
If you would also like to get separate function files (which you can put into
your <strong>$fpath</strong>), you can browse and download them at:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://git.grml.org/?p=grml-etc-core.git;a=tree;f=usr_share_grml/zsh;hb=HEAD">https://git.grml.org/?p=grml-etc-core.git;a=tree;f=usr_share_grml/zsh;hb=HEAD</a>

<h1>ZSH REFCARD TAGS</h1>

<p>
If you read <em>grmlzshrc</em>'s code you may notice strange looking comments in
it. These are there for a purpose. grml's zsh-refcard is automatically
generated from the contents of the actual configuration file. However, we need
a little extra information on which comments and what lines of code to take
into account (and for what purpose).
</p>
<p>
Here is what they mean:
</p>
<p>
List of tags (comment types) used:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>#a#</strong></dt><dd>
Next line contains an important alias, that should be included in the
grml-zsh-refcard. (placement tag: @@INSERT-aliases@@)
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>#f#</strong></dt><dd>
Next line contains the beginning of an important function. (placement
tag: @@INSERT-functions@@)
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>#v#</strong></dt><dd>
Next line contains an important variable. (placement tag:
@@INSERT-variables@@)
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>#k#</strong></dt><dd>
Next line contains an important keybinding. (placement tag:
@@INSERT-keybindings@@)
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>#d#</strong></dt><dd>
Hashed directories list generation: <em>start</em>: denotes the start of a list of
'hash -d' definitions. <em>end</em>: denotes its end. (placement tag:
@@INSERT-hasheddirs@@)
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>#A#</strong></dt><dd>
Abbreviation expansion list generation: <em>start</em>: denotes the beginning of
abbreviations. <em>end</em>: denotes their end.
\
Lines within this section that end in '#d .*' provide extra documentation to
be included in the refcard. (placement tag: @@INSERT-abbrev@@)
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>#m#</strong></dt><dd>
This tag allows you to manually generate refcard entries for code lines that
are hard/impossible to parse.
Example:
\

<pre>
#m# k ESC-h Call the run-help function
</pre>

\
That would add a refcard entry in the keybindings table for 'ESC-h' with the
given comment.
\
So the syntax is: #m# &lt;section&gt; &lt;argument&gt; &lt;comment&gt;
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>#o#</strong></dt><dd>
This tag lets you insert entries to the 'other' hash. Generally, this should
not be used. It is there for things that cannot be done easily in another way.
(placement tag: @@INSERT-other-foobar@@)
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
All of these tags (except for m and o) take two arguments, the first
within the tag, the other after the tag:
</p>
<p>
#&lt;tag&gt;&lt;section&gt;# &lt;comment&gt;
</p>
<p>
Where &lt;section&gt; is really just a number, which are defined by the @secmap
array on top of 'genrefcard.pl'. The reason for numbers instead of names is,
that for the reader, the tag should not differ much from a regular comment.
For zsh, it is a regular comment indeed. The numbers have got the following
meanings:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>0</strong></dt><dd>
<em>default</em>
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>1</strong></dt><dd>
<em>system</em>
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>2</strong></dt><dd>
<em>user</em>
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>3</strong></dt><dd>
<em>debian</em>
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>4</strong></dt><dd>
<em>search</em>
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>5</strong></dt><dd>
<em>shortcuts</em>
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>6</strong></dt><dd>
<em>services</em>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
So, the following will add an entry to the 'functions' table in the 'system'
section, with a (hopefully) descriptive comment:
\
</p>

<pre>
#f1# Edit an alias via zle
edalias() {
</pre>

<p>
\
It will then show up in the @@INSERT-aliases-system@@ replacement tag that can
be found in 'grml-zsh-refcard.tex.in'. If the section number is omitted, the
'default' section is assumed. Furthermore, in 'grml-zsh-refcard.tex.in'
@@INSERT-aliases@@ is exactly the same as @@INSERT-aliases-default@@. If you
want a list of <strong>all</strong> aliases, for example, use @@INSERT-aliases-all@@.

<h1>STATUS</h1>

<p>
This manual page is the <strong>reference</strong> manual for <em>grmlzshrc</em>.
</p>
<p>
That means that in contrast to the existing refcard it should document <strong>every</strong>
aspect of the setup.
</p>
<p>
This manual is currently not complete. If you want to help improving it, visit
the following pages:
